caption: 'A split-screen image. On the left, a dark, chaotic scene depicts traditional
  banking obstacles: tangled chains, a rusted padlock, stone blocks labeled "FEES"
  and "DELAY," and small icons for banks and old money. On the right, a bright, clear
  scene shows a smartphone with the "revolut" app, connected by sleek lines to various
  country flags (UK, Germany, USA, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Switzerland)
  and credit cards, all against a light blue map backdrop, symbolizing seamless global
  digital payments. The title "BEYOND THE BREEZE: IS REVOLUT THE ANSWER?" is prominently
  displayed across the top.'
