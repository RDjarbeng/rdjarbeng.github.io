There is nothing quite like a bowl of traditional Ghanaian groundnut soup. This recipe features a rich, creamy base made with hard chicken and a blend of aromatic spices like anise seed, cumin, and rosemary. Whether you serve it with fufu, omo tuo (rice balls), or boiled yam, it is the ultimate comfort food.

Achieving the perfect consistency for peanut butter soup can be tricky, but this method ensures a smooth, flavorful result every time. By steaming the chicken with a fresh ginger-garlic blend and pre-mixing the peanut butter with hot water [[02:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-BsuzhV2t8&t=127)], you create a deep, layered flavor that develops beautifully as the oil settles on top.

From the savory spice blend to the slow-simmered finish, this is how you make an authentic Ghana peanut butter soup that tastes just like home. Watch the full process to see why steaming your meat first is the essential time-saver for maximum flavor [[03:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-BsuzhV2t8&t=182)]
