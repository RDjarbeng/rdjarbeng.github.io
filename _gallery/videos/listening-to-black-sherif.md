As we step into the new year, it’s the perfect time to pause and deeply reflect on our personal journey. The turning of the year brings a wave of fresh opportunities, much like a bright sunrise breaking over the horizon after a dreadfully long and challenging night. It is a season for renewed hope, setting intentions, and embracing the future.

To visually capture that profound feeling of hope and renewal, I created this highly expressive AI-generated video. Powered by Google's Veo3 model, of a stick figure looking into the horizon.

The visuals are crafted to convey the emotion of stepping out of the darkness and into a brighter, more promising era. The AI beautifully translates complex emotional themes into stunning video art.

Set against this powerful visual backdrop is the incredibly inspiring track "So it Goes." This hit song is a phenomenal collaboration between Ghanaian superstar Black Sherif and renowned Nigerian artist Fireboy DML. Their signature blend of soulful Afrobeats and introspective lyrics perfectly encapsulates the mood of moving forward despite past hardships.

The video starts with the figure staring over a lake in the darkness, then the sun rises on cue with 'If you see the light..' in the song. Then it sets and the moon shines over the water and the stars appear as black sherif's voice fills the air with hope and inspiration. 
> If you see the light remember, that I was with you...🎵

Whether you are looking for motivation for the coming months or simply appreciate the intersection of cutting-edge AI videography and top-tier African music, this piece is designed to inspire. Take a moment, hit that reflective pose, and let the music guide you into a better tomorrow.
