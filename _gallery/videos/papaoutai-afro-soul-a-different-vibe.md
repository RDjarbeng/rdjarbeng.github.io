  The song is in French.

  Starts off with some harmonization and a beat. Then the vocals hit in French,... I don't speak French but I heard 'travaille' 😅. Then after the first verse the chorus hits and with the choir/backup singers joining in. Then a heavenly string sound plays (probably a violin). After the string instrument then we go into the second verse with a bang. A harder rendition than the first verse as the singer vocalizes the words with such emotion and increases his volume. At one point it feels like he's screaming the lyrics in sweet melodic echo as the beat continues to play. Shout "PAPA OUTAI" as the chorus begins again.

  Then at the end of the chorus everything goes quiet excluding the beat and the singers vocals. Softly this time he gently repeats the lyrics from the chorus in a _mellow _voice. He takes us low into a gentler tempo. The piano joins in the melody.  The choir also comes in to repeat the lyrics in a relaxing rendition. It eventually builds up as the singer at the height shouts, "EEI!", as the signal for the choir to give it all they've got and the choir responds,  **"OUTAI, PAPA OUTAI"** . The volume rises, the instrumentals join and the choir responds with a higher octave and more intensity as the song reaches a crescendo. They then get to the end of the song with an 'oh oh' vocable over the instrumental.

  _Disclaimer:_ Rumors are that this version in particular could be an AI cover of the original song made even though it's a vibe I am going to have to include this disclaimer in case it's true. If you want the original song you can find it here. [Stromae - papaoutai (official video / clip officiel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKj0Z_Xnjc)
