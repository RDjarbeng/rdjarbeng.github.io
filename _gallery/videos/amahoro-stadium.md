Filmed and produced by Richard Djarbeng, this YouTube video highlights the stunning architectural advancements that have transformed the Remera area into a world-class sporting and entertainment hub.

  The Amahoro Stadium, which translates to "Peace Stadium" in Kinyarwanda, recently underwent a massive, multi-million dollar expansion, significantly increasing its seating capacity and transforming its exterior into a magnificent, modern sporting bowl. Right next door sits the spectacular BK Arena, a state-of-the-art indoor facility that has quickly become the premier destination for major basketball tournaments across the continent.

  Together, these two phenomenal structures represent a massive shift in Rwanda's developmental goals. The government’s deliberate investment in top-tier sports infrastructure is designed to position Kigali as the ultimate destination for global sporting events, international concerts, and high-profile conferences, significantly boosting the country's tourism and economic profile. 

  If you are passionate about sports architecture, urban development, or simply love seeing the incredible progress happening within modern African cities, you must watch this video.
