Tired, uninspired, empty pages, 
you feel wasted 
frustrated
filled with hatred why does life have to be this way? I don't know but I can tell you it's all worth the pain when will I ever see things change? We start today just lift your head we'll Make A Way
Why are you heavy oh my soul? 
there's a fire inside my bones
 
Why are you heavy oh my soul
 Please don't cry no more 
Please don't cry no more

Eh oh 🎶
