caption: "Tired, uninspired, empty pages, \nyou feel wasted \nfrustrated\nfilled with\
  \ hatred why does life have to be this way? I don't know but I can tell you it's\
  \ all worth the pain when will I ever see things change? We start today just lift\
  \ your head we'll Make A Way\nWhy are you heavy oh my soul? \nthere's a fire inside\
  \ my bones\n \nWhy are you heavy oh my soul\n Please don't cry no more \nPlease\
  \ don't cry no more\n\nEh oh \U0001F3B6"
