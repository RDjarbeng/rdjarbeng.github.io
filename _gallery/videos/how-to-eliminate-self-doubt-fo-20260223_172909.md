caption: "Why do seemingly intelligent people procrastinate? Are there really hidden\
  \ patterns and belief systems within us that conspire against our best intentions?\
  \ In this talk, human behaviour expert, Peter Sage, exposes some of the hidden reasons\
  \ and unconscious patterns that cause us to self-sabotage and explains what we can\
  \ do to change them.\n\n\nPeter Sage is a well known international serial entrepreneur,\
  \ author, philosopher, personal growth expert, and teacher. His unique way of looking\
  \ at and relating to life has inspired millions of people worldwide to reinvent\
  \ themselves. Whether by improving or turning around a business or developing a\
  \ new and empowering psychology through practical yet profound shifts in awareness,\
  \ Peter hopes his insights and teachings can offer something of value to those who\
  \ seek it. To find out more about Peter, visit his website \u200B and subscribe\
  \ to his YouTube channel at \_\_\_\_/\_petersage007\_\_\u200B This talk was given\
  \ at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by\
  \ a local community."
