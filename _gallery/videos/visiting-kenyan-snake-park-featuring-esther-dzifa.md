  I have always had a fear of snakes, but I decided to challenge myself and visit the **Kenyan Snake Park** in Nairobi. In this video, I'm joined by **Esther Dzifa** from the channel [Growing with Dzidzi](https://www.youtube.com/@growingwithDzidzi).

  It was a test of courage as I got up close and personal with these reptiles. Watch to see if I managed to conquer my fear or if I ran for the hills! 😅
