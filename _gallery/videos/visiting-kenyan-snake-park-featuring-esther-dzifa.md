  # Facing One's Fears at the Kenyan Snake Park

Many of us have a deep-seated fear of snakes, and it was no different for Esther Dzifa from the YouTube channel [Growing with Dzidzi](https://www.youtube.com/@growingwithDzidzi). In this hilarious and heart-warming video, she takes us on her journey to the **Kenyan Snake Park** in Nairobi, where she decided to challenge her fears head-on.

## The Experience

Esther shared her heart-racing experience as she got up close and personal with these reptiles. After learning about the dangers and effects of their poisons, she finally summoned the courage to touch a snake. As she describes it, "it was a heart racing moment," and she was surprised to find that "snakes feel silky and soft and moist."

## The Lesson

Through this experience, Esther learned a valuable lesson: "Facing fear doesn't have to be dramatic. Sometimes it's just about showing up." Her bravery is truly inspiring, and her humorous storytelling makes for an entertaining watch.

Watch the video to see if she managed to conquer her fear or if she ran for the hills! 😅
