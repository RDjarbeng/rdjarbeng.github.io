  Tried out this cool computer vision app with my camera. Post made by @Avery on X/Twitter. I thought it was cool so decided to share.

  TransScript:

  Check out this Interactive particle playground.

   first I wanna see if I can control this with my mouse

  Then I'm gonna try the camera, it recognises my hands  wow

  Can't believe this was vibe coded with Claude Opus

  For some reason these pink particles remind me of that wallpaper from the anime demonslayer.

  Anyway, back to the app, to change the particles (attractors) as they're called you simply make a fist and it changes.  whoo!

  This was made by @Averycode on twitter.

  If you want to try it out I'll include the link in the video or description.  Rich man out
