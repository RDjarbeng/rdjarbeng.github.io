caption: "Tried out this cool computer vision app with my camera. Post made by @Avery\
  \ on X/Twitter. I thought it was cool so decided to share.\n\nhttps://x.com/DjarbengRichard/status/2009641438536184245\n\
  \nTransScript:\n\nCheck out this Interactive particle playground.\n\n first I wanna\
  \ see if I can control this with my mouse\n\nThen I'm gonna try the camera, it recognises\
  \ my hands  wow\n\nCan't believe this was vibe coded with Claude Opus\n\nFor some\
  \ reason these pink particles remind me of that wallpaper from the anime demonslayer.\n\
  \nAnyway, back to the app, to change the particles (attractors) as they're called\
  \ you simply make a fist and it changes.  whoo!\n\nThis was made by @Averycode on\
  \ twitter.\n\nIf you want to try it out I'll include the link in the video or description.\
  \  Rich man out"
