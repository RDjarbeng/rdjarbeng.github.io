caption: 'Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,

  Let not the mighty man glory in his might,

  Nor let the rich man glory in his riches;

  But let him who glories glory in this,

  That he understands and knows Me, That I am the LORD, exercising lovingkindness,
  judgment, and righteousness in the earth. For in these I delight," says the LORD.'
