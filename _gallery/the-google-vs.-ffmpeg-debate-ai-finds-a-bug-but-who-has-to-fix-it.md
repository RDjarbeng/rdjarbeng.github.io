caption: A vertical poster illustrating the Google vs. FFmpeg debate using a "David
  vs. Goliath" meme. A giant, menacing robot labeled "GOOGLE" holds an AI-themed magnifying
  glass and says, "I found bugs! You fix." Below, a small, heroic figure labeled "FFMPEG"
  stands on a cliff and replies, "But... who pays for it?" The text "GOOGLE VS FFMPEG"
  is in the center, with "rdjarbeng.com" at the bottom.
