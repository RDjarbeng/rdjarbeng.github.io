This guide is designed for foreigners arriving in Kigali, Rwanda, to help you navigate the banking landscape. Below is a list of major banks operating in Rwanda, focusing on their services, account types (Rwandan Franc [RWF] and US Dollar [USD] accounts), associated fees, interest rates, and foreign exchange capabilities. Where applicable, we’ve included the banks’ operations in other countries to give you a sense of their regional presence. This comparison aims to simplify your decision-making process when choosing a bank in Rwanda.

## 1. Ecobank Rwanda

- **Account Types**: Offers RWF and USD accounts.
- **Fees**:
- USD accounts: $20 initial deposit for non-RWF accounts, $4 monthly maintenance fee, $8 initial fee for cheque book for USD accounts withdrawals over the counter.
- USD withdrawals: 1% charge (recently introduced without prior communication from the bank).
- Cards: VISA cards provided upon request. Need separate cards for RWF and USD accounts.
- **Interest Rates**: No interest on USD accounts. Interest rates for RWF accounts are not publicly disclosed; contact the bank for details.
- **Services**:
- Foreign exchange services supporting multiple currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) via electronic transfers.
- International money transfers through SWIFT and partnerships with agents like Western Union and MoneyGram.
- Personal, business, and corporate banking products, including loans and trade finance.
- **Ecobank Mobile App**:
- Allows transfers to other Ecobank Rwanda account holders and to other banks in Kigali.
- Enables free transfers to other USD account holders within Ecobank’s network.
- Supports cross-border transfers to Ecobank accounts in other countries at a fee (generally cheaper than SWIFT), but both sender and recipient must be Ecobank customers; otherwise, a SWIFT transfer is required.
- Note: When converting USD to RWF via the app (for customers with both USD and RWF accounts), the exchange rate is typically less favorable than withdrawing USD and exchanging at a forex bureau in Kigali.
- **Other Countries of Operation**: Ecobank is a pan-African bank with a presence in 33 African countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Africa.
- **Notes for Foreigners**: Ideal for those needing multi-currency transactions or regional transfers due to Ecobank’s extensive African network. The mobile app is convenient for local and USD transfers, but be cautious of the 1% USD withdrawal fee and less competitive app-based exchange rates for USD to RWF conversions. The USD Visa card works internationally; for instance, if buying an item on Amazon in the US costing $50, exactly $50 will be deducted when the USD card is used without additional charges.

## Key Considerations for Foreigners

- **Account Opening Requirements**: Most banks require a passport, 1–2 passport photos, and an initial deposit (typically $3–$20 for non-RWF accounts). Some may request a work permit or 3-month bank statement from a previous bank, but this varies (e.g., Equity Bank requires 6 months of banking for loans, while I&M may require only 1 month).
- **Foreign Exchange**: Rwanda’s foreign exchange market is liberalized, allowing banks to offer multi-currency accounts and international transfers with minimal restrictions. However, exporters must repatriate earnings within three months.
- **Cash vs. Digital**: Rwanda, especially outside Kigali, is largely a cash-based or mobile money economy. ATMs are available but less widespread than in Western countries.
- **Recent Updates**: Be aware of unannounced changes, such as Ecobank’s new 1% USD withdrawal fee. Always confirm fees and rates directly with the bank.

## How to Choose

- **For International Transfers**: Ecobank and I&M Bank are strong choices due to their regional networks and SWIFT/BRISK capabilities. Ecobank’s app is particularly useful for free USD transfers within its network.
- **For Stability**: Bank of Kigali, with its dominant market share, is a safe bet for local reliability.
- **For Digital Banking**: BPR Bank and Equity Bank provide robust mobile banking options, while Ecobank’s app excels for intra-bank and USD transfers.
