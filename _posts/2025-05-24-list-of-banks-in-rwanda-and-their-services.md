## 1. Ecobank Rwanda

Main Headquarters: [Lomé, Togo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobank_Group)

Operates in 36 other African countries with some subsidiaries outside the African continent.

- **Account Types**: Offers RWF and USD accounts.
- **Fees**:
    - USD accounts: $20 initial deposit for non-RWF accounts, $4 monthly maintenance fee, $8 initial fee for cheque book for USD accounts withdrawals over the counter.
    - USD withdrawals: 1% charge (recently introduced without prior communication from the bank).
    - Cards: VISA cards provided upon request. Need separate cards for RWF and USD accounts.
- **Interest Rates**: No interest on USD accounts. Interest rates for RWF accounts are not publicly disclosed; contact the bank for details.
- **Services**:
    - Foreign exchange services supporting multiple currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) via electronic transfers.
    - International money transfers through SWIFT and partnerships with agents like Western Union and MoneyGram.
    - Personal, business, and corporate banking products, including loans and trade finance.
- **Ecobank Mobile App**:
    - Allows transfers to other Ecobank Rwanda account holders and to other banks in Kigali.
    - Enables free transfers to other USD account holders within Ecobank’s network.
    - Supports cross-border transfers to Ecobank accounts in other countries at a fee (generally cheaper than SWIFT), but both sender and recipient must be Ecobank customers; otherwise, a SWIFT transfer is required.
    - Note: When converting USD to RWF via the app (for customers with both USD and RWF accounts), the exchange rate is typically less favorable than withdrawing USD and exchanging at a forex bureau in Kigali.
- **Other Countries of Operation**: Ecobank is a pan-African bank with a presence in 33 African countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Africa.
- **Notes for Foreigners**: Ideal for those needing multi-currency transactions or regional transfers due to Ecobank’s extensive African network. The mobile app is convenient for local and USD transfers, but be cautious of the 1% USD withdrawal fee and less competitive app-based exchange rates for USD to RWF conversions. The USD Visa card works internationally; for instance, if buying an item on Amazon in the US costing $50, exactly $50 will be deducted when the USD card is used without additional charges.

## Key Considerations for Foreigners

- **Account Opening Requirements**:
    - Most banks require a passport, 1–2 passport photos, and an initial deposit (typically $3–$20 for non-RWF accounts). Some may request a work permit or 3-month bank statement from a previous bank, but this varies (e.g., Equity Bank requires 6 months of banking for loans, while I&M may require only 1 month).
- **Foreign Exchange**:
    - Rwanda’s foreign exchange market is liberalized, allowing banks to offer multi-currency accounts and international transfers with minimal restrictions. However, exporters must repatriate earnings within three months.
- **Cash vs. Digital**:
    - Rwanda, especially outside Kigali, is largely a cash-based or mobile money economy. ATMs are available but less widespread than in Western countries.
- **Recent Updates**:
    - Be aware of unannounced changes, such as Ecobank’s new 1% USD withdrawal fee. Always confirm fees and rates directly with the bank.

## How to Choose

- **For International Transfers**:
    - Ecobank and I&M Bank are strong choices due to their regional networks and SWIFT/BRISK capabilities. Ecobank’s app is particularly useful for free USD transfers within its network.
- **For Stability**:
    - Bank of Kigali, with its dominant market share, is a safe bet for local reliability.
- **For Digital Banking**:
    - BPR Bank and Equity Bank provide robust mobile banking options, while Ecobank’s app excels for intra-bank and USD transfers.
