When a Windows update unexpectedly interrupts your work and forces a restart, you don't have to worry about losing all your carefully organized Chrome windows and tabs.

You also don't have to go through the tedious process of restoring the tabs manually using keyboard commands like `Ctrl+Shift+T` on Windows or `Cmd+Shift+T` on Mac—which I used to do all the time.

Instead, you can enable a simple setting in Google Chrome that tells the browser to automatically pick up right where you left off.

## How to Resume Chrome Tabs on Startup

Here is how you can set it to resume on start:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Go to the browser **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **On startup** from the left menu.
4. Select the **Continue where you left off** option.

By default, Chrome shows "Open the New tab page", but making this small switch makes a huge difference in productivity!

Now, regardless of whether you have to reboot for an update or simply shut down for the night, all your vital tabs will respawn completely intact when you launch Chrome again.
