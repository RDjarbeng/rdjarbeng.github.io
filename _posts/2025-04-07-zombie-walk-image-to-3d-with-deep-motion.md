So I tried a little experiment to animate this picture of a character walking. Why does it matter you ask well I was speaking to a game developer friend of mine and he said creating characters especially work cycles was one of the most difficult challenges when it comes to game development so I had this brilliant idea where I thought if I could do that with ai I could speed up the game development process maybe come up with some solution and that's where my problem started.

So I got I got Bing image generator to generate an image of a character going through the different work cycles of stopping walking with a left foot walking with a right foot and in stride the results were pretty good as shown below. whistling

Then I animated the image using runway ML and got some kind of decent results even though the output is not exactly the best now to convert it to a game ready format I had to find some kind of 3D animation studio a tool that could convey the movement from the video to some kind of 3D model and first of all first of

I came upon deep motion which is supposed to be a tool you can use to convert or rather to generate 3D models from text or images and videos that could then be exported to a game engine such as unity on our unreal engine.

The results show that my 3D character works more like a zombie than an actual human being or game character. Even though it's not the best I think I'm going to take this win. 

 I also tried this with a with an image to 3D representation of this robot I generated earlier with Bing image generator and it seems to have done a good job. I'll add a video of that underneath this post so you can see the output for yourself.

Although this method of generating images and then video and then 3D models is not yet perfect I think this is a good start and hopefully as AI advances this would lead to a better result next time I try this. There are also other 3D animation tools or AI studio tools you can use which I can't wait to try out hopefully I can find a better one that can work with videos then maybe I can speed up my game developments progress or at least help some game devs.

Here's the animated image I turned into a video using RunwayML.

This is the generated video from runway ML. It's not perfect but I'll allow it.

Here's the video of the robot 3D model from deep motion showing the transfer of the walking motion from the video to the 3D character in the deep motion studio in the browser. Some of the comments I got from this was that it works like a zombie and I must admit it's kind of working like a zombie not like a real person. Here is the output video of the character walking  like a zombie
