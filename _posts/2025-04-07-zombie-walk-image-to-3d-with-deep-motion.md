I recently ran a little experiment to animate a character walking, starting from a single image. Why does this matter? Well, I was chatting with a game developer friend who mentioned that creating charactersâ€”especially their walk cyclesâ€”is one of the toughest challenges in game development. That sparked an idea: if I could use AI to streamline this process, it might speed up game development or even offer a new solution. Here's a quick glimpse of the end result with the 3D model mimicking the pose of a 2D character.

And so, my journey began. 

## The process

First, I used [Bing Image Generator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) to create an image of a character in various stages of a walk cycleâ€”stopping, stepping with the left foot, stepping with the right, and mid-stride. The results were surprisingly solid, as you can see below.

Next, I took that image into [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) to animate it into a video. The output wasnâ€™t perfect, but it was decent enough to work with. Hereâ€™s the video output from RunwayML. Itâ€™s not flawless, but Iâ€™ll take it:

The real challenge came when I needed to convert this into a game-ready 3D format. I needed a tool that could translate the motion from the video into a 3D model, something I could export into a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine.

Thatâ€™s when I discovered [DeepMotion](https://www.deepmotion.com/), an AI tool designed to generate 3D models from text, images, or videos.

With their 'Animate 3D' video to 3D animation model  I gave it a shot with my animated walk cycle, and the result? Well, my 3D character moves more like a zombie than a polished game character. Itâ€™s not ideal, but Iâ€™m calling it a win for a first attempt.

## The final output:

Below is the video of the robot 3D model from DeepMotion, showing how the walking motion transferred from the video to the 3D character in their browser studio. I also tested this workflow with another imageâ€”a robot Iâ€™d generated earlier with Bing Image Generator. DeepMotion handled this one better, and Iâ€™ve included it in the end of the video so you can check out the results for yourself:

Some feedback I got suggested it moves like a zombieâ€”and honestly, I canâ€™t disagree. Itâ€™s more undead than lifelike, but hereâ€™s the output for you to judge:

While this processâ€”going from images to video to 3D modelsâ€”isnâ€™t perfect yet, I think itâ€™s a promising start. As AI tools improve, Iâ€™m hopeful this could lead to better outcomes in the future. There are other 3D animation and AI studio tools out there too, and Iâ€™m excited to experiment with them. If I can find one that works even better with videos, it might just speed up my game development processâ€”or at least help out some game devs along the way.
