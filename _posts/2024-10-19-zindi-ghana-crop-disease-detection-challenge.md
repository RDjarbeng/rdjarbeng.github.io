Zindi, in partnership with GIZ, Digital Transformation Centre Ghana, Fairforward, and the Responsible AI Lab, has launched the Ghana Crop Disease Detection Challenge. This challenge focuses on building machine learning models to identify diseases affecting tomato, corn, and pepper crops through mobile phone images.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, crop diseases and pests reduce yields by up to 40% annually, significantly impacting food security and the regionâ€™s economy. This competition aims to create models that can accurately predict all diseases present in images of these crops. Participants must build models that can generalize well, even when encountering diseases not seen in the training set, and operate efficiently on edge devices, such as entry-level smartphones used by most subsistence farmers in Africa.

#### Prizes:

- 1st place: USD 4,000*
- 2nd place: USD 2,500*
- 3rd place: USD 1,500*

*Please note that only African citizens are eligible for prizes.

The competition closes on 15 December 2024.
