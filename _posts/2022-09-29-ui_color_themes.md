![Light mode and dark mode comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa1035db-077c-439a-971e-5f8a002daaeb)

As a developer, my respect for UX and UI has skyrocketed since conducting a small survey on color theme preferences for an application. The results were eye-opening and highlighted the complexities of user preferences.

## What I Observed:

1. First impressions matter: Users' responses often changed based on which theme they saw first.
2. Side-by-side comparison effect: Some users switched their choice after seeing dark and light modes together.
3. Bias is inevitable: User opinions can be influenced by various factors, making it challenging to get truly objective feedback.

This experience made me reflect on the potential biases we, as developers, might unconsciously bring to our work. How often do we make assumptions about what users want without proper verification?

## The Developer's Dilemma

While gathering more information to drive our decisions is crucial, what happens when the feedback is split down the middle? For instance, if preferences are tied at around 50-50 between light and dark modes, how do we proceed?

This brings up an interesting question: In such scenarios, should we rely on our gut instinct and experience to guide our decisions?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts. How do you approach these UX/UI dilemmas in your projects?
