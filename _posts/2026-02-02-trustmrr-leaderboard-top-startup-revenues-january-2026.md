For years, the "Indie Hacker" and startup community has been plagued by a subtle dishonesty: fake revenue screenshots. It became too easy to inspect an element and manipulate the content on a website, change a `$0` to a `$10,000`, and post it on Twitter to build hype. Even "Open Startups" often self-reported numbers that couldn't be audited. 

Enter **TrustMRR**.

## What is TrustMRR?

TrustMRR is a database of *verified* startup revenues. It was built by prolific indie maker **Marc Lou** (famously in just 24 hours) to solve the crisis of credibility in the ecosystem. 

Unlike other directories where founders simply type in their revenue, TrustMRR requires a direct, cryptographic proof of income. It is the "blue checkmark" for startup financials—but instead of paying Elon Musk $8 on Twitter, you pay with transparency.

### How does verification work?
The "secret sauce" of TrustMRR is its reliance on API integrations rather than human honesty.
1.  **Read-Only Access**: A founder cannot just claim they make money. They must connect their payment processor (primarily **Stripe**, but now also **LemonSqueezy**, **Polar**, and others) via OAuth.
2.  **Algorithmic Audit**: TrustMRR’s server-side algorithms scan the connected account. Crucially, they filter the data to calculate *genuine* MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue). 
3.  **No Cheating**: The system is designed to ignore one-time fees, refund-heavy transactions, and non-recurring spikes that often inflate self-reported numbers.
4.  **Real-Time Sync**: The number you see on the leaderboard isn't from last quarter's investor deck. It is updated hourly.

### Is it free?
Yes. For startups, getting listed is completely free. The platform creates a win-win loop: founders get a verified badge of honor that helps with recruiting or selling their business, and TrustMRR monetizes through advertisements on the high-traffic leaderboard.

## The January 2026 Leaderboard

Now that we know these numbers are real, looking at them is much more interesting. The leaderboard for **January 2026** reveals that while AI is hot, the "Creator Economy" is the one actually paying the bills.

## Insights from the Data

1.  **The Creator Economy is Mature**: **Stan**'s revenue is nearly 4x its closest competitor on this list. The tools enabling creators are becoming massive businesses themselves.
2.  **AI is for Niches**: The successful AI companies here aren't building "General AI"; they are building "AI for Resumes" (**Rezi**), "AI for Social Posts" (**Followr**), or "AI for DMs" (**DM Champ**). Specialization is winning.
3.  **B2B Infrastructure is Sticky**: Tools like **Cometly** (ad tracking) and **1Capture** (payments) solve painful, expensive problems for other businesses, leading to solid recurring revenue.

TrustMRR's leaderboard is a great reminder that while hype cycles come and go, the companies building real utility—whether it's helping someone get a job, lose weight, or sell a product—are the ones ringing the register.
