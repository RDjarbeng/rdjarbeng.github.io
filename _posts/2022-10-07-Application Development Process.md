# Is there a general process to follow to build an application?
Generally, it is a good idea to break down the steps you need and then test each one before moving to the next.

However, the particular process to follow will depend on the company and their techniques, such as agile, and the specific application you are building.

An example of a process some may follow:

### Initial plan:
Idea → prototype → final application.

After some experience, the building process may be similar to:

Develop initial idea → test prototype → discussion/review feedback → 2nd test (beta) → 2nd discussion/review → final test for errors (fingers crossed) → deploy final application

Of course, the steps here are not a definitive guide and more steps may be added in-between. As always, you will navigate errors with Google and Stack Overflow as your trusty helpers.
