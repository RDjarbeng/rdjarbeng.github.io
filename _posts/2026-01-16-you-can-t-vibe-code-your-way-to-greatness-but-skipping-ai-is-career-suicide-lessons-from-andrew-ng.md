Andrew Ng's recent article in *The Batch* newsletter (published September 3, 2025) makes a compelling case about how **AI is fundamentally reshaping the skills that define a great developer**. In "AI Skills Are Redefining What Makes a Great Developer," he highlights the growing demand for engineers who can effectively integrate AI tools into their workflow, while emphasizing that core fundamentals remain essential.

### Key Takeaways from Andrew Ng's Article

Ng points out a clear market reality: there's **significant unmet demand** for developers skilled in using AI to build applications faster and more productively. Companies—both large enterprises and startups—are eager to hire hundreds of such engineers, but many recent computer science graduates are facing higher unemployment because university curricula haven't caught up to this AI-driven shift in programming.

He describes the ideal AI-savvy developer as someone who can:
- Use AI assistance to rapidly engineer software systems
- Leverage AI building blocks like prompting, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), evals, agentic workflows, and machine learning
- Prototype and iterate at high speed

Developers with these capabilities can accomplish **"a massively greater amount"** compared to traditional 2022-style coding (manual coding without heavy AI reliance).

Ng uses a powerful historical analogy: the transition from punchcards to keyboards and terminals. Employers initially kept hiring punchcard experts, but eventually everyone had to adapt. He sees **AI engineering as a similar wave of change** — inevitable and transformative.

A standout quote captures his balanced view on fundamentals vs. hype:

> "Without understanding how computers work, you can’t just ‘vibe code’ your way to greatness. Fundamentals are still important, and for those who additionally understand AI, job opportunities are numerous!"

He acknowledges that some older skills (like memorizing syntax) are becoming less critical, but estimates that **even if 30% of traditional CS knowledge becomes obsolete**, the remaining 70%—when combined with modern AI proficiency—creates truly productive developers.

Ng also pushes back against the stereotype of "AI Native" fresh grads automatically outperforming veterans. While he's hired new graduates who excel at AI over experienced developers stuck in old methods, he stresses that **the best developers** are experienced ones who have adapted to AI tools, with deep knowledge of computers, software architecture, and complex tradeoffs.

In short, Andrew Ng argues that pure traditional coding is no longer enough in 2025/2026, but neither is relying solely on superficial AI use.

### My Take — I Completely Agree with Andrew Ng

I fully align with his perspective. You absolutely **can't "vibe code" your way to greatness** without solid fundamentals — blindly accepting AI outputs without understanding the underlying systems will limit you on complex projects, debugging tricky issues, or making smart architectural decisions.

At the same time, it's **no longer wise** (or competitive) for any developer to avoid becoming adept with AI in their daily workflow. Ignoring tools like code assistants, prompting techniques, RAG setups, or agentic patterns means you're choosing to work much slower than your peers who embrace them. AI doesn't replace deep thinking; it amplifies developers who already think deeply.

The sweet spot today is blending timeless CS principles with cutting-edge AI fluency — exactly what Ng describes as the path to being highly productive and in-demand.

If you're a developer (or aspiring one), I highly recommend reading the full article yourself for Andrew Ng's complete thoughts and his signature clear, insightful style:
