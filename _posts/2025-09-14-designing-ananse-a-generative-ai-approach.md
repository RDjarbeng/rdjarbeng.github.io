How do you design a character of legend? A myth? Known only from stories told by grandparents to their grandchildren. A character so wise that his wisdom extends beyond his hut and places he’s travelled. A character who is said to sometimes be a spirit, sometimes a man, sometimes a spider and sometimes just a fleeting whisper told to scare children into behaving. If you could paint him it would be easy to have a way to visualize what he looks like. Unfortunately this character comes from a time before modern smartphones or else we would have pictures of him we can reference. Also, this character sometimes represents the desires of man itself, such as greed? How do you paint a picture of greed? Of envy? Of cunning and shrewdness?

If you could encapsulate all of this in one image you would have the trickster character known as ANANSE.

## Who is Ananse?

Ananse, often spelled Anansi, is a prominent figure in West African folklore, particularly among the Akan people of Ghana and other parts of the African diaspora, including the Caribbean. He’s a trickster character, usually depicted as a spider, a man, or a combination of both, known for his cunning, wit, and resourcefulness. Here’s how I’d describe him to someone new to the concept:

Ananse is a clever, mischievous spider who stars in countless stories passed down through generations. He’s not your typical hero—think of him as a sly, quick-thinking underdog who uses brains over brawn to outsmart stronger opponents, like gods, animals, or even humans. He’s charming but selfish at times, often weaving schemes to get food, power, or glory, though his plans don’t always go perfectly. In many tales, he’s a cultural icon who brings wisdom or stories to humanity, like the time he tricked the sky god Nyame to share all the world’s stories with him. His personality mixes humor, greed, and ingenuity, making him both relatable and unpredictable.

For example, in one popular story, Ananse captures a python, a leopard, and a hornet to trade for Nyame’s stories, using clever traps and deception. Yet, he’s not infallible—his tricks can backfire, teaching lessons about humility or consequences. In the Caribbean, especially in Jamaica, his tales blend with local traditions, and he’s often called “Nancy” or “Aunt Nancy.”

## A picture of Ananse from GenAI

Here is my humble attempt to illustrate a folktale legend based on the few stories I know. Obviously I didn’t sit down over days with a paint brush or pencil to try and draw him in this modern age. I tried instead to describe this character to various AI models, and have them figure out how to draw them. You can say this is a use case of generative AI or GenAI for short. Let’s take a look at the outputs.

### Firefly from Adobe

Unfortunately I lost the original prompts I used to generate these images when I was first exploring the description of ananse. Adobe firefly has undergone some changes and it seems those prompts were not saved and are now lost to the winds that carried away the knowledge in the pot of wisdom.

🕷️🍯 Greed, the defining trait of Ananse the trickster!

This concept art perfectly captures his sly and cunning nature, with his bald head, big belly, and that unmistakable look of unwillingness to share. It's ironic how his insatiable greed often leads him into trouble in his captivating tales. Behold, Ananse and the pot of wisdom! 🎭✨

### Bing image Generator

We moved to bing image generator, because we don't want any watermarks and adobe keeps on messing with us; right now I can't find the prompts for my old image generations and they can't seem to make up their minds if this will be a free feature.
