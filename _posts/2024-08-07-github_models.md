GitHub is enabling the rise of the AI engineer with the introduction of GitHub Models, bringing the power of industry-leading large and small language models to its more than 100 million users directly on the platform.

With GitHub Models, every developer can become an AI engineer, or so they say, with the right tools and training. From playground to coding with the model in Codespaces to production deployment via Azure, GitHub Models demonstrates how simple it can be. Users are invited to sign up for the waitlist to be among the first to experience GitHub Models. By joining the waitlist, users will have the opportunity to test and provide feedback on this innovative tool, helping GitHub to refine and improve it.

GitHub Models include access to models such as Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Phi 3, and Mistral Large 2. Users can interact with these models through a built-in playground that allows them to test different prompts and model parameters for free, right within GitHub. More details can be found in the full blog post by GitHub CEO, Thomas Dohmke! ðŸš€
