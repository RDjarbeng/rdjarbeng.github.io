Just when you thought Elon Musk couldn't surprise us anymore, he's done it again! Elon Musk and his team at SpaceX have _again_ successfully caught a 33-story building-sized rocket, the Super Heavy booster, coming from space at supersonic speeds. This isn't just rocket science; it's a feat of engineering marvel that pushes the boundaries of what we thought possible in space travel.
