Banks frequently market Visa and Mastercard products as tools for quick and convenient transactions. However, there is one functionality that is _conveniently_ missing; transferring money directly from these cards to another card holder.  Transfers between bank accounts is not a standard feature. Unlike the cards typical use in point-of-sale or online purchases, direct transfers typically require involvement from a bank or a third-party service, each with associated costs and limitations. These also take substantial time to process so even if two card users wish to conduct an exchange they may have to wait some hours _or days_ to complete the transfer. This post outlines the distinction between their advertised capabilities and actual functionality.

## How Banks Present Visa and Mastercard

Visa and Mastercard are widely promoted by financial institutions for their speed and ease of use. For example, Visa’s website highlights “fast, secure payments” accepted globally, while Mastercard emphasizes “convenient transactions” in its branding. Banks echo this, often advertising debit and credit cards as versatile tools for managing money. However, these claims primarily apply to payments—purchasing goods or services—not to transferring funds directly to another bank account.

## Limitations of Direct Transfers

Visa and Mastercard operate as payment networks, facilitating transactions between cardholders and merchants. According to Visa’s operational guidelines, their system processes over 200 billion transactions annually, almost entirely for payments, not interbank transfers. Direct transfers to bank accounts typically rely on systems like SWIFT or ACH, which these cards are not designed to access independently. As a result, cardholders cannot initiate a transfer to a bank account or card holder without additional steps.

## Bank Involvement in Transfers

Most banks do not allow Visa or Mastercard to fund wire transfers directly. For instance, a 2023 survey by the American Bankers Association found that 78% of U.S. banks require funds to originate from a checking or savings account for international wires, not a credit or debit card. When transfers are permitted, fees apply: domestic wire transfers average $25, while international ones range from $40 to $50, per Bankrate’s 2024 data. Additionally, if a card is used, banks may classify the transaction as a cash advance, incurring fees of 3%-5% (e.g., $15-$25 on a $500 transfer) and higher interest rates, often above 20% APR.

## Third-Party Services as an Alternative

Services like Wise, PayPal, and Venmo enable card-funded transfers to bank accounts, bridging the gap. Wise, for example, charges 0.43%-1.0% plus a fixed fee (e.g., $4.14 for a $500 USD-to-USD transfer, per their March 2025 fee calculator). PayPal’s fee for card-funded transfers is 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction domestically, with higher rates for international sends. However, banks may still apply cash advance fees, adding 3%-5% to the cost. These services process transfers via their own networks or SWIFT, not the Visa or Mastercard payment rails.

From my experience with Wise (formerly TransferWise), the fees you pay can vary depending on the card you use. For example, when I transferred money from my USD Visa card—issued outside the US in Rwanda—to a US bank account, the charge jumped from $26 to around $100 once Wise identified the card’s issuing bank. Without involving the bank that issued the card (though Wise operates a bit like a bank itself), the transfer fee ended up being higher than what I would have paid through a traditional bank transfer ($40 to $50). Also the third party may use existing bank transfer systems SWIFT, WIRE, etc. and charge you extra fees compared to if you had used traditional methods.

Another peculiar problem I have experienced using these 3rd party apps also involves the direction of the payment. For instance you could find that on some third-party apps, _cough_ Remitly _cough_ you can send money from the US, UK to Ghana, Brazil or any supported country. However, you can't do this in the reverse to send from some of the receiving countries to the US or UK. Maybe it's my fault for thinking remittances work both ways.

Even if the charges were better than using a regular bank, many people might prefer not to hand their financial details to a 3rd party. 

## Why Transfers Differ from Payments

Payments via Visa or Mastercard use a closed-loop system: cardholder to merchant, processed instantly through the card network. Transfers, however, involve moving funds between accounts, often across banks or borders, requiring infrastructure like SWIFT (handling $5 trillion daily, per SWIFT’s 2024 report) or ACH (68.1 billion transactions in 2023, per Nacha). Cards lack direct access to these systems, limiting their role to payment initiation, not fund movement.

## Key Takeaway

Visa and Mastercard excel as payment tools, processing billions of transactions yearly, but they are not built for direct bank account transfers. Banks and third-party providers enable such functionality, typically at a cost ranging from $5 to $50 per transfer, depending on the method and amount. Cardholders seeking to move money must navigate these additional layers, as the cards’ core design prioritizes payments over transfers.

_PS: Apart from the charges mentioned here most banks charge a fixed amount for receiving funds via transfers with a card or SWIFT transfer. You might find the receiver short by 15 or 20 USD after you have already paid the charges. Yes, this applies even if the sender chooses to pay for the transfer charges. And yes sadly I was a victim of this._
