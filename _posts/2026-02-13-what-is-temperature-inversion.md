A temperature inversion is a,meteorological phenomenon where a layer of warm air sits over a layer of cooler air near the Earth's surface, reversing the normal atmospheric condition where temperature decreases with height. Acting as a "lid" or "cap," it traps cold air, pollutants, fog, and moisture, leading to poor air quality and stagnant weather conditions. 
Key Aspects of Temperature Inversions:
Causes: Most commonly occur on calm, clear winter nights via radiation cooling, where the ground cools rapidly, cooling the air immediately above it. They also form in high-pressure systems where sinking air warms, or when warm air masses move over cold surfaces.
Impact on Air Quality: Because the inversion layer prevents vertical mixing, pollutants from cars, wood burning, and industry become trapped, resulting in unhealthy, hazy, or smoky conditions.
Effects on Weather: Suppresses convection, which stops cloud formation, and often creates fog or low stratus clouds.
Types:
Radiation Inversion: Occurs at night as the surface loses heat.
Advection Inversion: Occurs when cool air moves in under warm air, common on coasts.
Subsidence Inversion: Caused by sinking air in high-pressure systems.
Frontal Inversion: Occurs when a warm air mass overrides a cold air mass. 
These atmospheric inversions can last for hours or days, particularly in valleys where cold air gets trapped against surrounding terrain.
