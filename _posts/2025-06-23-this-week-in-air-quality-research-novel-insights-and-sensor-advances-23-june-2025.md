I have been keeping up with air quality research to understand emerging risks, technological advances, and policy implications. This week I'm spotlighting literature that highlights the increasing role of low-cost sensors, real-time exposure assessment, and high-resolution monitoring—from global cities to African urban centers. Below, I summarize some key papers, discuss their impact, and provide references for deeper exploration. African-focused research is separated for emphasis.

## 🌍 Global Research Highlights

### Occupational Exposure & Sensor Innovation

- **Real-Time PM Exposure in Mining**
- _Summary_: Pradhan et al. used low-cost sensors to monitor particulate matter (PM) exposure among heavy earth moving machinery (HEMM) operators in opencast coal mines. Findings show that in-cabin exposures, while lower than outside, still exceed safety thresholds—highlighting the need for better occupational protections.
- _Novelty_: Real-time, occupation-specific exposure assessment using scalable sensor networks.
- _Reference_: [Estimation of real-time PM exposure and associated health risk of HEMM operators using low-cost sensors in a highly mechanised opencast coal mine](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-025-01769-6) (Pradhan et al., 2025) [1]
- **Correcting Low-Cost Sensor Data for Humidity**
- _Summary_: Lekamge & Oswin developed practical approaches for correcting relative humidity (RH) biases in low-cost PM2.5 sensors—crucial for ensuring data reliability in diverse climates.
- _Impact_: Paves the way for regulatory-grade use of affordable sensor networks.
- _Reference_: [Exploration of a practical approach to providing RH corrections to low cost sensor networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01115-8) (Lekamge & Oswin, 2025) [2]
- **Bus-Based Urban Air Quality Monitoring**
- _Summary_: Matroca evaluated a sensor system installed on buses, demonstrating cost-effective, real-time urban air quality mapping. Challenges remain in calibration and data consistency.
- _Potential_: Scalable for city-wide, dynamic pollution tracking.
- _Reference_: [A Low-Cost Sensor System Installed in Buses to Monitor Air Quality in Cities](https://www.academia.edu/download/100408779/pdf.pdf) (Matroca, 2025) [3]

### Urban Pollution Dynamics & Source Attribution

- **Mobile PM10 Hotspot Mapping**
- _Summary_: Walzelova et al. used mobile sensors for high-definition mapping of PM10 hotspots in urban areas, revealing sources often missed by stationary monitors.
- _Reference_: [Simultaneous mobile PM10 monitoring provides high definition spatial and time localization of hotspots of poor air quality in an urban environment (PDF)](https://karolinum.cz/data/clanek/14905/EJES_15_1_0034.pdf) (Walzelova et al., 2025) [4]
- **Commuter Exposure to NO2 and PM2.5**
- _Summary_: Mainka et al. assessed personal exposure during commutes, finding higher exposures in cars and during winter. Highlights the importance of microenvironments in health risk.
- _Reference_: [Exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 While Commuting: Utility of Low-Cost Sensor](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/11/5965) (Mainka et al., 2025) [5]
- **Aircraft Ultrafine Particle Emissions**
- _Summary_: Van Loenen et al. differentiated ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions from aircraft in airport-adjacent communities, providing crucial data for local air quality management.
- _Reference_: [Aircraft Arrival and Departure Contributions to Ultrafine Particle Size Distribution in a Near-Airport Community](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5c04799) (van Loenen et al., 2025) [6]

### Source-Specific & Modeling Advances

- **Vehicle Emissions in Real Traffic**
- _Summary_: Lu et al. measured real-world emissions (CO, NOx, CO2, PM2.5) from gasoline and diesel vehicles, showing diesel’s outsized PM2.5 contribution.
- _Reference_: [Real-traffic emissions of CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5 from vehicles using a portable emission measurement system](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-025-01765-w) (Lu et al., 2025) [7]
- **Oil Imports and PM2.5 in China**
- _Summary_: Tosun et al. linked China’s oil imports to rising PM2.5 concentrations, emphasizing the global interconnectedness of air pollution.
- _Reference_: [Analyzing the impact of oil imports on air pollution proxied by PM2.5 concentrations in China](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MEQ-12-2024-0592/full/html) (Tosun et al., 2025) [8]
- **Urban PM2.5 Simulation with Mobile Data**
- _Summary_: Li et al. used mobile monitoring to improve spatiotemporal PM2.5 modeling in cities, boosting accuracy by 40% over traditional methods.
- _Reference_: [Fine simulation and spatiotemporal analysis of urban PM2.5 using Mobile monitoring data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095525002147) (Li et al., 2025) [9]

## 🌍 Africa-Focused Research

### Nairobi, Kenya: Long-Term PM2.5 Monitoring

- **Summary**: Waiguru et al. conducted the longest low-cost sensor study in Nairobi (2020–2022), mapping PM2.5 variability across multiple sites. Seasonal peaks were observed during dry periods, with industrial and traffic-heavy zones consistently exceeding safe limits.
- **Novelty**: Provides rare, high-resolution, long-term data for sub-Saharan Africa, informing targeted interventions and policy.
- **Reference**: [Seasonal multisite low-cost sensor measurements to estimate spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter pollution in Nairobi, Kenya](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104225002326) (Waiguru et al., 2025) [10]
