_Developer from Nairobi, Kenya._

I found a repository of web development projects on GitHub which belongs to Peter Kimanzi, a web developer from Nairobi. The site that really caught my eye was a kind of animation that follows the mouse cursor as it moves on the screen and was inspired by the TV series Stranger Things.

I admire his work and I am also surprised to see he built some of his websites, including his portfolio website, with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Beautiful! In my opinion, for one man’s work.

I’ve posted screenshots of his work with this post. (Sorry, I couldn’t include both images and video of the Stranger Things site in this post).

Find his portfolio site here:

Interesting developer, interesting repository.
