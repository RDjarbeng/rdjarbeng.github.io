## What are Static Sites?

Static sites are web pages that are delivered to the user exactly as stored, without any server-side processing. They are typically created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and do not change in response to user actions. This contrasts with dynamic sites, where content is generated on-the-fly based on user interactions, database queries, or other real-time factors.
### Examples of Static Sites:
- **Portfolio Websites**: Showcasing personal work or projects with a fixed set of pages.
- **Blogs**: Sites like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered blogs that are pre-built and do not change unless redeployed.
- **Documentation Sites**: Providing static documentation for software or tools, such as [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

### Examples of Dynamic Sites:
- **E-commerce Sites**: Websites like Amazon, where the content (products, user data) changes based on user interactions and database queries.
- **Social Media Platforms**: Sites like Facebook or Twitter, where user-generated content is constantly updated and personalized.
- **Web Applications**: Apps like Google Docs or Trello, where the interface and data dynamically update based on user input and real-time collaboration.

Static sites are known for their simplicity, security, and speed, as they do not require server-side scripting or databases. They are ideal for blogs, portfolios, documentation, and other content that does not require frequent updates or user-specific data.
