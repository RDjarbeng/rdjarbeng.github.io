In the wake of the devastating wildfires sweeping through the Los Angeles area, **Planet Labs**, known for their satellite imagery services, has stepped up to offer crucial support. On January 9, 2025, Planet announced through a [tweet](https://x.com/planet/status/1877395904820555919) that their Crisis Response Program has made available select non-commercial data for those directly involved in or supporting the response efforts.

## Satellite Data for Emergency Response

Planet's initiative is a beacon of hope during these trying times. By providing access to their SkySat imagery, including near-infrared capabilities, they are enabling a more informed and efficient response to the Palisades Fire, which has been ravaging parts of Los Angeles. This data, available under Planet's non-commercial Crisis Response license, can be accessed through a secure web portal, emphasizing the company's commitment to aiding in crisis situations. To sign up for access, qualified users are directed to visit [Planet's Crisis Response portal](https://www.planet.com/disasterdata/).

## Community and Support

The response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive. Jason Horton (@Space_Horton) praised Planet Labs for their altruistic efforts, stating, "Good job Planet Labs in helping for free when it's needed most - you're not just a company, you're a good bunch of people." Similarly, Mitch Summers (@mitch_summers) applied for media access to gather images, both for personal reasons and to investigate the fire's origin, showcasing the dual use of this data for personal memories and public safety.

## The Impact of Climate Change

The wildfires in Los Angeles are a stark reminder of the escalating impact of climate change. The combination of increased heat, prolonged drought, and the notorious Santa Ana winds has created a perfect storm for wildfires. This incident follows a pattern of severe fire seasons exacerbated by these climatic conditions, highlighting the urgency for effective response mechanisms and long-term environmental strategies.

**Stay safe, Los Angeles.**
