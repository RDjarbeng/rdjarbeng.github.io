Ever noticed how most websites—from a New York Times article to your email inbox—don't use the full width of your screen? This isn't a mistake; it's a deliberate design choice.

Many websites and email formats use narrow, single-column layouts, typically **600–700 pixels wide**, to dramatically improve the user experience. It all boils down to readability, focus, and mobile-friendliness.

## The Core Benefits: Readability, Focus, and Mobile

There are three primary reasons why this design pattern is so effective and popular.

### 1. It’s All About Readability

Research shows that the optimal line length for comfortable reading is **50–75 characters**. Narrow layouts achieve this sweet spot.

* **Long lines** (like text stretching 100% across a wide monitor) cause eye fatigue. Your eyes have to travel a long distance from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, making it easy to lose your place.
* **Optimal lines** make content easier to scan and digest, reducing eye strain. ([Elementor Blog: Website Layout Ideas](https://elementor.com/blog/website-layout-ideas/))

### 2. We Live in a Mobile-First World

With over 50% of web traffic coming from mobile devices, a narrow layout is the foundation of **responsive design**. A 600px-wide column on a desktop can "stack" or "reflow" perfectly onto a 375px-wide phone screen without needing horizontal scrolling. This single-column approach ensures a consistent, usable experience on any device. ([LinkedIn Pulse: Common Website Layouts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/common-website-layouts-mohammad-zeeshan))

### 3. It Enhances Focus and Reduces Cognitive Load

A narrow column surrounded by white space (or "negative space") helps focus your attention on the content. It limits visual distractions and reduces **cognitive load** by presenting information in a single, digestible, top-to-bottom path, which is perfect for content-heavy pages.

## Where Did This Trend Come From?

This isn't just a new digital trend. It’s rooted in centuries of print media. Newspapers have always used columns to improve readability—it's a time-tested principle.

The rise of **mobile-first design** in the early 2010s simply reinforced this principle for the digital age, making it a standard for good, accessible design. ([MDN Web Docs: Column Layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Column_layouts))

## My Take: Putting It Into Practice

This preference for scannability is exactly why the posts list on my own website uses a multi-column layout. While a post _itself_ is single-column for reading, the _list_ of posts is broken into a two-column layout. This groups the content into smaller, defined "cards," making it easier to browse—it's the same principle of readability applied in a different context!

### The Takeaway

Next time you notice that "empty" space on the sides of a website, you’ll know it’s not wasted—it’s a deliberate choice for better readability, focus, and usability.
