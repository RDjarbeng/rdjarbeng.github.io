If you've ever taken an AWS, DevOps, or cloud architecture course (especially ones like Adrian Cantrill's fantastic content on learn.cantrill.io), you've probably noticed the signature style: fun, sketchy hand-drawn icons, whimsical characters (goblins for bad actors!), flowing arrows, and smooth step-by-step animations that reveal concepts progressively.

This isn't your grandma's Microsoft PowerPoint. It's a modern, informal, engaging visual language that's taken over tech education — and it's super easy to recreate yourself.

### The Tools Behind the Magic

Most creators in this space rely on free, open-source, browser-based whiteboard tools that deliver that authentic **hand-drawn/wobbly line aesthetic**. Here's the breakdown of the top contenders in 2026:

#### 1. Excalidraw (Still the King for Many)
- **Website**: [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)
- Why it's perfect: Signature rough, hand-sketched look that's instantly recognizable.
- Huge community libraries — including tons of AWS-specific icon packs (many styled to match the fun, sketchy vibe).
- Supports grouping elements and "appear on click" reveals → ideal for building progressive diagrams.
- Export as SVG/PNG, then record screen + clicks for those smooth animations (using OBS Studio or similar).
- **Free**, open-source, collaborative, and no sign-up needed.

It's the go-to for countless tech educators, system design interviews, and architecture explainers because it feels like drawing on a real whiteboard — just digital and shareable.

#### 2. tldraw (The Rising Modern Favorite)
- **Website**: [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com)
- Even smoother interface and drawing experience than Excalidraw in many opinions.
- Infinite canvas, beautiful handwriting feel, dot-grid backgrounds, and excellent support for multi-step / complex diagrams.
- Great for progressive reveals and layering — many creators switched here in 2024–2025 for the polish.
- Also **free**, open-source, and increasingly popular in dev communities.

If the diagrams feel a tiny bit cleaner or more fluid than classic Excalidraw, tldraw is likely the culprit.

#### 3. diagrams.net (draw.io) + Creative Styling
- **Website**: [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)
- Official AWS icon sets built-in (super accurate and professional).
- Apply "rough" or sketch styles to shapes to get close to the hand-drawn look.
- Built-in animation features (flowing arrows, step-by-step) and export options.
- Still widely used when precision matters more than pure whimsy.

### How the Smooth Animations Actually Get Made

These tools don't have Hollywood-level animation timelines, so here's the common workflow:

1. Build the diagram in **layers/groups** (e.g., background → base architecture → arrows → fun monsters last).
2. Use "appear on click" or simple reveal sequencing.
3. **Screen record** while clicking through steps (OBS Studio, Loom, QuickTime, or CapCut are free and easy).
4. Add voiceover + timing tweaks in free editors like **DaVinci Resolve** or **CapCut**.
5. Result: That satisfying progressive build-up without needing After Effects.
