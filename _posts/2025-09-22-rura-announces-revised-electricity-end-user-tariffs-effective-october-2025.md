The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) has notified the public of a revision to the Electricity End-User Tariff. The revised tariffs will take effect on 01 October 2025.
In residential households, the threshold for the lowest consumption bracket has been extended from 15 kWh to 20 kWh per month, maintaining affordability for basic needs. 

## Rate changes for residential households

**0-20 kWh** per month: RWF **89** per kWh (unchanged from previous rate).
**20-50 kWh** per month: RWF **310** per kWh, an increase from RWF **212**.
Above **50 kWh** per month: RWF **369** per kWh, up from RWF **249**.

For a detailed breakdown of the new rates, see the tables below (VAT exclusive; 18% VAT applies to all rates).

## App for electricity calculation

Calculating how much electricity I get from the table is time consuming, so I created an app to help calculate this. It gives the approximate units in kWH you receive per RWF and vice versa. This takes into account the 18% VAT and displays the breakdown of costs across tiers. Also added a feature to calculate the remaining kWH if you have already paid for electricity at the beginning of the month.
