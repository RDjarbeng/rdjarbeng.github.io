When Windows 11 first launched, it brought a major visual overhaul—including a centered Start button and taskbar icons. While this new look is modern and macOS-like, many long-time Windows users found it jarring. If you've spent years (or decades) reaching for the bottom-left corner, retraining that muscle memory can be frustrating.

The good news? You don't have to get used to it. Moving everything back to the classic left-aligned position is built right into the settings and takes literally four clicks—no registry hacks or third-party tools required.

### How to Move the Start Button to the Left

1.  **Right-click** on any empty spot on the taskbar.
2.  Select **Taskbar settings** from the context menu.
3.  In the settings window, scroll down and click on **Taskbar behaviors**.
4.  Look for the **Taskbar alignment** option and change the dropdown from **Center** to **Left**.

That’s it! Your Start button and all pinned icons will instantly snap back to the left side, restoring the classic Windows layout you know and love.

### Why Change It?

For many, this isn't just about aesthetics; it's about efficiency. The bottom-left corner is an "infinite target" (mostly)—you can throw your mouse cursor into that corner without looking and click, knowing you'll hit the Start button. With a centered taskbar, the position of the Start button shifts depending on how many icons you have open, requiring you to actually *aim* each time.

By moving it back to the left, you regain that consistent anchor point, potentially speeding up your workflow just a tiny bit every time you launch an app.

Enjoy your sanely-aligned taskbar! 🚀
