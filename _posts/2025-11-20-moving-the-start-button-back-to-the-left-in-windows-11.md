title: Moving the Start Button Back to the Left in Windows 11

When Windows 11 first launched, many people were surprised (and annoyed) that the Start button and taskbar icons were centered by default. The good news? Moving everything back to the classic left-aligned position takes literally four clicks—no registry hacks, no third-party tools required.

### How to do it:
1. **Right-click** on an empty spot on the taskbar.  
2. Choose **Taskbar settings**.  
3. Scroll down and click **Taskbar behaviors**.  
4. In the **Taskbar alignment** dropdown, select **Left**.

That’s it! The Start button and all your pinned/taskbar icons instantly jump back to the left side, just like in Windows 10 and earlier.
