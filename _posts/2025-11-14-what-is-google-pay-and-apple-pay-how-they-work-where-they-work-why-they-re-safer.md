In a world where your phone is your wallet, **Google Pay** (also known as the [Google Wallet](https://wallet.google/)) and [**Apple Pay**](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) have become essential tools for millions. But what exactly are they? How do they differ from your regular bank account? And can you use them everywhere, including in Africa and Asia?

Let’s break it down.

## What Are Google Pay and Apple Pay?

**Google Pay / Google Wallet** is a digital wallet platform and app for **Android users**. It lets you:

* Store credit/debit cards, tickets, and loyalty cards
* Pay in stores with a tap (using [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication))
* Send money to friends (in select countries)
* Pay online with one click

[**Apple Pay**](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) does the same — but for **iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac** users. It’s built directly into the Wallet app and uses **Face ID or Touch ID** for security.

> **Important**: Neither is a bank account. They **link to your existing cards** — your money stays with your bank.

## How Are They Different from a Regular Bank Account?

| Feature | Bank Account | Google Pay / Apple Pay |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Holds money? | Yes | No (except [Apple Cash](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102290) in US) |
| [FDIC insured](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/)? | Yes | No |
| Earns interest? | Sometimes | No |
| Direct deposit? | Yes | No |
| Physical card? | Yes | Uses your phone |
| Security | PIN, 2FA | **[Tokenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_\(data_security\))** + biometrics |

**Tokenization** is the key. It means your real card number is **never shared** with merchants. A unique, one-time code is generated for each transaction, making it **significantly safer than swiping your physical card**.

## Why Not Just Use Your Bank Card?

You absolutely _can_ — but here’s why digital wallets often win:

* **Faster**: Tap and go. No fumbling for a card or entering a PIN for most transactions.
* **Safer**: If you lose your phone, you can freeze it remotely. If your physical card is stolen, it's a much bigger risk.
* **Convenience**: Your phone is almost always with you; your wallet might not be.
* **Online Checkout**: One-tap payments in apps and browsers (Safari/Chrome) without re-entering card details.
* **Extra Rewards**: Some card issuers offer bonus cashback for using Apple or Google Pay.

> **Pro tip**: Link your bank card to your phone's wallet to get the best of both worlds.

## Do They Work with All Cards and in All Regions?

**No.** This is the most important part. Support depends entirely on your **bank**, **card network (Visa/Mastercard)**, and **country**.

### Supported Card Networks

* **Both**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express
* **Apple Pay**: + Discover, JCB, UnionPay
* **Google Pay**: + Elo (Brazil), UPI (in India)

### Global Availability (Excluding Sanctioned Countries)

Both services are available in **80–90+ countries**, but with major gaps, especially in Africa.

| Region | Apple Pay | Google Pay / Wallet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **North America** | US, Canada | US, Canada |
| **Europe** | 40+ countries (UK, Germany, France, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, etc.) | 50+ countries (Most of EU + UK, Jordan, Pakistan) |
| **Asia-Pacific** | Strong in Japan, Singapore, Australia, India (limited), China (UnionPay). | Strong in India (via UPI), Japan, Singapore. Support is launching in the Philippines. |
| **Africa** | **Only South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco** | **South Africa only** |
| **Latin America** | Brazil, Chile, Mexico | Brazil (QR + NFC), Mexico |

> **Sanctioned countries** (like Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea): **No access** to these services due to U.S. sanctions.

## Banks in Africa and Asia?

Support is bank-by-bank. Here are a few examples:

### Africa

* **South Africa** (Apple Pay & Google Pay): [Absa](https://www.absa.co.za/), [Nedbank](https://www.nedbank.co.za/), [Discovery Bank](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.discovery.co.za/bank/)
* **Egypt & Morocco** (Apple Pay only): Local banks like [Banque Misr](https://www.banquemisr.com/en/) and [Attijariwafa Bank](https://www.attijariwafabank.com/en/).
* **Most of Africa**: No official support. Daily transactions rely on mobile money leaders like [M-Pesa](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa) and [MTN MoMo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mtn.com/momo/).

### Asia

* **India**: [HDFC Bank](https://www.hdfcbank.com/), [ICICI Bank](https://www.icicibank.com/), SBI (Google Pay is dominant via the UPI system)
* **Singapore / Malaysia**: [DBS](https://www.dbs.com/), [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/), [Maybank](https://www.maybank.com/)
* **Japan / South Korea**: Most major banks are supported.
* **Philippines**: Launching soon with banks like [BPI](https://www.bpi.com.ph/) and [UnionBank](https://www.unionbankph.com/).

> **Always Check Your Bank**: The _only_ way to know for sure is to check the official lists.

## Key Caveats & Limitations

| Issue | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Bank Must Participate** | Your card won't work just because it's a Visa. Your specific bank must have a deal with Apple/Google. |
| **Merchant NFC Needed** | The store's terminal must accept tap-to-pay. This is common in cities but rare in rural areas. |
| **Bank Fees Still Apply** | Using Apple/Google Pay abroad doesn't avoid your bank's [FX fees](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange-fee.asp) (1–3%) or foreign transaction fees. |
| **Phone Must Have NFC** | This includes any iPhone 6 or newer, and most mid-to-high-end Androids from the last 5+ years. |
| **Battery Dies = No Pay** | This is the biggest one. If your phone is dead, you can't pay. |
| **Travel Tip** | Notify your bank of your travel plans, just as you would with a physical card, to avoid fraud blocks. |

## Should You Use Google Pay or Apple Pay?

**Yes — if**:

* You value speed, security, and the convenience of not carrying a wallet.
* You travel frequently to supported countries.
* You shop online and in apps often.
* Your bank and country are on the supported list.

**Stick to your card — if**:

* You’re in an unsupported region (like most of Africa).
* You don't trust phones for payments or are worried about battery life.
* You prefer using cash or local mobile money systems.

## Final Verdict

**Google Pay and Apple Pay aren’t replacements for your bank** — they’re **upgrades to your physical wallet**. They make payments faster, safer, and more convenient... _if_ your bank and region play along.

> **Traveling soon?** Add your card to your phone's wallet _before_ you leave and test it with a small purchase at home. And **always** carry a physical backup card.
