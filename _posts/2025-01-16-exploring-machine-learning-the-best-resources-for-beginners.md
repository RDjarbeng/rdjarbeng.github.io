If you're just stepping into the world of machine learning, finding the right resources can feel like navigating a labyrinth. Thankfully, Jason Brownlee at Machine Learning Mastery has compiled an excellent guide titled ["Best Machine Learning Resources for Getting Started"](https://machinelearningmastery.com/best-machine-learning-resources-for-getting-started/). Jason Brownlee has earned a reputation for providing solutions to machine learning errors and seems to be a good person to take recommendations on where to start. I his [words](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/), he  helps  **developers** get results with **machine learning**."

**Why This Guide Stands Out:**

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Jason doesn't just list books or courses; he provides a broad spectrum of resources including blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, and even community forums where you can learn from others and share your experiences.
- **Curated by an Expert:** With his background, Jason Brownlee has firsthand knowledge of what works for beginners. His selection ensures you're not just reading through a list but engaging with high-quality, relevant material.
- **Practical Focus:** One of the strengths of this guide is its emphasis on practical learning. Each resource is chosen to help you move from theory to practice, understanding how machine learning algorithms work in real-world scenarios.

**Key Resources Highlighted:**

- **Books:** From foundational texts like "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" to more specialized reads, Jason picks books that cater to different learning styles and levels.
- **Courses:** Whether you prefer structured learning through online platforms like Coursera or interactive experiences on platforms like Kaggle he considers the varied learning styles.AI
- **Blogs and Websites:** For those who learn best through reading, blogs like those from Google AI or Fast.ai offer up-to-date insights into the field.
- **Communities:** Learning is not just about consuming content but also interacting with peers. Platforms like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or Stack Overflow are invaluable for community support.

**Why Should You Care?**

Machine learning is transforming industries, and understanding its basics can open up numerous opportunities, whether you're looking to switch careers or enhance your current skill set. This guide by Machine Learning Mastery acts as your map, ensuring you don't waste time on less effective resources.

**Start Here:**

For anyone eager to dive into machine learning without feeling overwhelmed, check out Jason Brownlee's curated list at [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/best-machine-learning-resources-for-getting-started/). It's your first step towards not just understanding but mastering the art and science of machine learning.

My recommendation:

If you read all this way and want my personal recommendation I would suggest to take Jeremy Howard's [course](https://course.fast.ai/) on fast ai - Practical deep learning for coders. This would be most useful to you if you already have some knowledge of programming in python.

Previously I wrote a post about this here: `[fastai-Practical deep learning without a PhD](https://rdjarbeng.github.io/RDjarbeng/introducingfastai/)`
