With over 4200 stars on Github, the complete machine learning package provides a way to learn machine learning by â€˜ understanding and doingâ€™. It was created by [Jean de Dieu Nyandwi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyandwi/) and is an awesome resource for beginners to machine learning in python.

It begins with an introduction to basic python and data analysis using tools like numpy and pandas, then goes on to data analysis and â€˜classicalâ€™ machine learning before going into deep learning and other advanced areas of machine learning. It has recently been updated with a section onÂ  MLOps. It is open-source and accepting contributions as wellðŸ’».

The advantage of this is that you get to learn machine learning using python in a comprehensive and structured manner where the tutorials are linked instead of randomly learning concepts.
