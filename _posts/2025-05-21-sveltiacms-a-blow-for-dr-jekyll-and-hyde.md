## What is a CMS?

**TL;DR**: SveltiaCMS continues to evolve, delivering essential features that make content management a breeze.

In my previous [post](https://rdjarbeng.github.io/story-time-add-a-cms-to-a-jekyll-github-pages-website/) about navigating _CMS hell_, I shared how I switched to [SveltiaCMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) to escape the tedious process of manually creating and naming files and images for my website which runs on Ruby(Jekyll). 

![Sveltia CMS logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/3b8a8751d79a940c34448aaf328edb3da467d64f/src/lib/assets/sveltia-logo.svg "Sveltia CMS logo")

Before SveltiaCMS, I relied on a code editor like VS Code to manage my website's posts. Now, I edit posts directly through a user-friendly interface on my website, similar to crafting a tweet or a Facebook update. I simply enter my text, add images, and hit _Post_.

### Overcoming Early Challenges

In my earlier post, I noted a few limitations with SveltiaCMS:

> "Unfortunately, SveltiaCMS is not a full solution. It doesn’t allow me to add images within posts by just dragging or selecting. So, I still have to type the file paths to images to add them to this post. Hopefully [Kohei Yoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino) will work on this soon.  
> P.S. I don’t know what the full meaning of OAuth is. Hope to find out soon."

I’m thrilled to report that these issues have been resolved! SveltiaCMS now includes a **native image picker**, eliminating the need to manually enter file paths. I can also **drag and drop multiple images** into the editor when creating a post. Plus, there’s support for copying images from other websites and linking to them seamlessly.

### Stellar Support and Community

One of SveltiaCMS’s standout features is its exceptional support. If you encounter an issue, you can open a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues), and the creator, [Kohei Yoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino), is likely to respond promptly. When preparing this post, I checked my GitHub issues and found that all six of my previously reported issues had been resolved with effective fixes. It’s refreshing to see a project that genuinely prioritizes its users. See screenshot below.

The SveltiaCMS Discord community is another highlight, with Kohei actively engaging with users. I once reported an issue while he was on a flight, and thanks to in-flight WiFi, he fixed it before landing!

### Why SveltiaCMS Stands Out

SveltiaCMS has transformed how I manage my website, making updates as simple as posting to social media. With recent improvements like the image picker and drag-and-drop functionality. The active community and stellar support only sweeten the deal.

If you’re looking for a CMS that’s lightweight, intuitive, and actively maintained, I highly recommend giving SveltiaCMS a try. It’s become an indispensable tool for my website, and I’m excited to see where Kohei takes it next!

_P.S. I looked into OAuth—it stands for&#32;**Open Authorization**, a protocol for secure, token-based access to resources. Mystery solved!_
