What is a CMS?

TLDR.   SveltiaCMS keeps improving and adding features that a CMS should have.

In my last [post](https://rdjarbeng.github.io/story-time-add-a-cms-to-a-jekyll-github-pages-website/) on what I called CMS hell, I switched over to SveltiaCMS to save myself the pain of manually creating and naming files and  images for my website. 

![Sveltia CMS logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/3b8a8751d79a940c34448aaf328edb3da467d64f/src/lib/assets/sveltia-logo.svg "Sveltia CMS logo")

Before I used a code editor such as vscode to edit posts on my website, now use a part of the website to edit the website posts. Like making a twitter post.

Essentially making an update to my website is now similar to a facebook or twitter post where I enter my text for the post, add images and hit post.

But I had some issues with this: 

> "Unfortunately SveltiaCMS is not a full solution. It doesn’t allow me to add images within posts by just dragging or selecting. So I still have to type the file paths to images to add them to this post. Hopefully [Kohei Yoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino) will work on this soon. 
> PS: I don’t know what the full meaning of OAuth is. Hope to find out soon."

However since that original post I am happy to announce that all these issues and more have been fixed. Now there is a native image picker. So I don't have to memorize file names.

I can also drag and drop multiple images into the window when creating a post. Even the ability to copy images from other pages online and link to them.

### Support:

The nice thing about SveltiaCMS is that there is an active Discord community with the creator Kohei actively working on this.

He is super responsive, so much so that I once reported an issue whilst he was on a flight and he actually fixed it before landing. Thanks to in-flight WiFi. See screenshot below.
