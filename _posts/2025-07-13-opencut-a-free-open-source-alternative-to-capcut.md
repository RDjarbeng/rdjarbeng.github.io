If you're a video editor frustrated with CapCut's recent changes, you're not alone. CapCut, once marketed as a free app, has shifted to a freemium model, adding watermarks to exported videos for free users on mobile and desktop and locking previously free features behind a paywall. Many users feel betrayed by this bait-and-switch tactic, as CapCut lured them in with free features only to reveal a more restrictive, premium-focused side. This growing discontent has sparked interest in open-source alternatives, and one project is stepping up to fill the gap: **OpenCut**.

## Meet OpenCut: The CapCut Alternative You’ve Been Waiting For

[OpenCut](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut) is an open-source video editing tool designed to deliver a powerful, user-friendly experience without the frustrations of CapCut’s new restrictions. Built to run in your browser, OpenCut offers:

- **Privacy First**: All video processing happens locally on your device, ensuring your content stays private.
- **No Watermarks**: Export your videos without any branding or restrictions.
- **Free Forever**: Unlike CapCut, OpenCut is committed to providing core editing features without paywalls.
- **Timeline-Based Editing**: Enjoy multi-track support and real-time previews, making editing intuitive and seamless.

Currently in its early stages, OpenCut is rapidly developing and already supports essential features like timeline editing, multi-track functionality, and watermark-free exports. The project is hosted on GitHub, where a vibrant community is contributing to its growth.
