I built a simple 3D game in November 2024 mostly for fun.  The objective was to minimize the time taken for a player to destroy all the pillars. Then I got a brilliant _(in hindsight not so brilliant)_ idea ðŸ’¡. Why not add a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play the game I made? I'd always wanted to do some hands-on RL. Sounded like a great idea with the best of intentions, what could possibly have gone wrong.

## Project Overview

This project featured a robot and an 'alien' character navigating through a custom-designed 3D environment.

- **Gameplay Objective**: The primary goal was to minimize the time it took for the RL agent to destroy all the pillars within the environment. Each pillar, when destroyed, scored 100 points, adding a competitive edge to the gameplay.
- **Environment**: A 3D space where the robot and 'alien' character interacted with pillars. Here's a visual representation of the game:
  

## Reinforcement Learning Agent

- **Initial Setup**: The RL agent started with an epsilon value of around 0.4. This meant:
- 40% of the actions taken by the agent were random (exploratory), allowing it to discover new strategies.
- 60% of the actions were based on exploitation, maximizing reward based on previously learned information.
- **Learning Process**: As the game progressed, the epsilon value decreased, transitioning the agent from exploration to exploitation, refining its strategy over time. To decrease epsilon I divided it by a constant factor I had hardcoded.
- **Current Status**: The agent encountered an issue where it got stuck after destroying approximately 4 pillars. The robot character also had jerky motion that just didn't look good especially at the start. This was where development paused, but _hopefully_ there was potential for further refinement. 

Here's an earlier screen recording I made below

## Features

- **Destruction Mechanics**: The game featured dynamic explosions when the character impacted a pillar, enhancing the visual and interactive experience.
- **Scoring System**: Each pillar destroyed awarded the player 100 points, encouraging efficiency and strategy in gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D environment and characters.
- **ReactJS**: For managing the game's UI and state, if you were interested in contributing or experimenting with the RL agent.

## Getting Started

If you were interested in continuing the development or experimenting with the RL agent, here's what you needed:

1. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with ReactJS and 3D modeling would have been beneficial.
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you had Node.js installed for ReactJS development. Or you could have used an online IDE like stackblitz (honestly that was the same environment I used to code this)
3. The link to the [repository was here](https://github.com/RDjarbeng/3d-character-game)
