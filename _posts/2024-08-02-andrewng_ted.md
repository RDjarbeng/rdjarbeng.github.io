In this TED talk by Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain and deeplearning.ai, he believes that artificial intelligence (AI) systems should be more widely available and accessible, so that even small businesses such as local pizza shops can use them to make data-driven decisions and improve their profitability and productivity.

Currently, AI systems are mostly accessible to large tech companies because they are expensive to build and maintain and require highly skilled engineers. However, he envisions a future where AI can be democratized and made more accessible to all businesses, similar to how information and digital tools are more widely available in the present day.

Could AI assist small businesses such as a local pizza shop, supermarket, or clothing retailer in improving their operations with only a small amount of data available to them?
