It is a common frustration, and you are spot on—**pressure** is one of the primary culprits. When wearing over-ear (circumaural) headphones, the discomfort usually stems from a combination of mechanical force and environmental factors.

Here is a breakdown of why it happens and how to fix it.

## 1. The "Clamping Force" Issue

Most ear pain from over-ear headphones is caused by **clamping force**—the lateral pressure the headband exerts to keep the earcups against your head.

* **The Problem:** If the tension is too high, it compresses the temporal bone and the cartilage of the outer ear (pinna). This can restrict blood flow or irritate the nerves around the ear.
* **The Fix:** You can "break in" new headphones by stretching them over a row of books or the headphone box overnight. Just be careful not to overstretch and snap the headband.

## 2. Temporal Pressure & Eyeglasses

If you wear glasses, the earpads press the temple arms of your glasses against your head.

* **The Problem:** This creates a localized pressure point that can cause a dull ache or even a tension headache over time.
* **The Fix:** Look for "glasses-friendly" replacement earpads made of **memory foam**, which conforms better to the shape of the glasses’ arms, reducing the "pinch."

## 3. Heat and Humidity (The "Greenhouse" Effect)

Over-ear headphones create a seal to improve bass and noise isolation.

* **The Problem:** This seal traps body heat and moisture. The increase in temperature can cause the skin to become sensitive or slightly swollen, making the physical contact of the pads feel more painful than it actually is.
* **The Fix:** Opt for earpads made of **velour or breathable mesh** rather than protein leather (pleather). Taking "air breaks" every 45–60 minutes is also essential.

## 4. Driver Depth (Contact Pain)

Sometimes the pain isn't from the clamping, but from your ear actually touching the hard plastic inside the cup.

* **The Problem:** If the earpads are too shallow, the "pinna" (the outer cartilage) rubs against the driver cover.
* **The Fix:** Purchase **thicker aftermarket earpads** (like those from Brainwavz or Dekoni). This increases the "cup depth," ensuring your ears float freely inside the chamber.

### Quick Troubleshooting Table

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Quick Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Top of head aches** | Headband weight | Add a padded headband cover. |
| **Outer ear cartilage stings** | Shallow earcups | Swap for deeper/thicker pads. |
| **Jaw or temple pain** | High clamping force | Stretch the headband slightly. |
| **Burning sensation** | Heat buildup | Switch to breathable fabric pads. |

Since you mentioned you’re often working on development and engineering projects, you're likely wearing these for long stretches. If you're using a specific pair right now that’s giving you trouble, let me know the model—I might be able to suggest a specific mod or pad replacement for them!
