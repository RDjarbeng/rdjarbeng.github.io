Limits of Generative AI: My Experience with Luma AI and Virtual Bees.

 I recently tried out Luma AI's  [dream machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine) using a picture of what I believe are wasps or bees (though I'm not entirely sure which!).. 

### What I Did
After signing up for a Luma Labs account, I uploaded my chosen image to their platform. Below is the input image I used:

![Many bees with one large bee or flying insect in the background](/assets/images/bees_luma.jpeg)

I then entered this simple prompt:

```
Move the insects in a realistic manner
```
After a short wait, the results were in.

### Result

The dream machine AI recognized the image as one of flying insects, and it attempted to animate them. However, it struggled with making the wings flap realistically. To give the attempt some credit, the bees in the background seemed to move their wings slightly. While the body of the insect moved like a flying object, it didn't quite capture the nuances of how insects actually fly which I found hilarious.

In reality, a bee can't move forward or tilt its body the way the AI made it do without flapping its wings. This is an interesting example of generative AI's limitationsâ€”specifically, its lack of understanding of the physical laws that govern the real world.

The original image was generated using Bing Image Creator, which may have influenced the AI's performance ðŸ¤–. However I am yet to verify this hypothesis.
