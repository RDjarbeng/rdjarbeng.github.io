Here is a screen recording for the ‘Stranger Things’ animation website from developer [Peter Kimanzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-kimanzi-002299206/). I mentioned it in a previous post and I thought you would appreciate it more if you could see it for yourself. Notice the mouse pointer and how the ‘creatures’ follow.
