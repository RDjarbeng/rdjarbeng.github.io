title: A smart guide for navigating software-AI tools as support agents
layout: post
---
Sometimes what I use these AI tools for: as a help section for different apps. For example I find asking Grok or Gemini about fusion360 a CAD modeling tool, how to configure certain settings in my browser, what the new app I just downloaded can do and how to work with certain features is better, in terms of time consumed, than browsing their documentation or watching training videos. For instance if I wanted to add a payment link for an item on my website for users to purchase, a tutorial probably exists but from my forecast I might spend hours implementing something that probably should take minutes if I know what I'm doing.

Previously, if I wanted to do something specific in a certain software/App, I would search for the task on Google hoping to find some documentation, forum or stackoverflow post similar to what I'm doing. For example if I want to implement a loading animation when my website content is loading so that it seems interactive, I might have to follow a general tutorial on 'an introduction to animations for website' then try to apply the content that was in the tutorial to my use case. This works sometimes if the content is similar enough to what I aim to do. Other times you might have to follow 3 or 4 tutorials before you find what you're looking for, browse a couple of stackoverflow posts with devs in heated arguments on how to implement it. If you are lucky you might find what you're looking for but if not you'll waste so much time heading in a direction that could be far from where you are actually going.

An analogy for this is travelling by bus. Suppose you come to a city and you want to get to a tourist attraction, say the Town Hall. You take a bus that's heading in that general direction and get as close as possible to the area where this Town hall  is located and then alight the bus try to figure out how to get to the entrance of this Town Hall. Perhaps, walking or taking another means of transport. You may find that you have to take multiple buses, walk quite a distance or wind up lost in an unknown place farther from the destination than you intended. Now imagine if you had 5 places of this nature to visit before sunset you will be in for a rather stressful day. You now find yourself learning the different streets and how to navigate different neighbourhoods. Between you and your goal is a myriad of possible paths that could take you to your destination.  From tourist to navigator, not exactly what you had in mind when you set off.At a certain point you might conclude that you don't even know what you're doing.

(I wish I had a graphic here for different paths through a city to get to a destination with paths highlighted, showing some reaching the destination and others at a dead end)

 In the end you'll probably learn a lot about the city you're visiting when you finally get to your destination but let's be honest you can't keep doing this for every city you visit. Let's look at an ideal solution. An ideal solution is to drive directly to this town hall without risk of deviating, in our example, this would be a tutorial for the particular task you want to accomplish. 

(I wish I had a graphic here for different paths through a city to get to a destination with paths highlighted, but with the best path highlighted and all other paths faded)

However, we don't always get ideal solutions, do we? We don't always have our own car in every city we plan to visit. A practical solution is to get a friend or local/tour guide to help you navigate the city and get to the town hall with the least hassle. The advantage of this is that it is tailored to your needs, understands your goal and minimizes deviations as much as possible. If it's an AI navigator it's probably Google maps or another GPS navigation app. 

This analogy of a friend to guide you is the case of using an AI tool to tell you how to perform a particular task in an app/software. Skip the long tutorial, show me how to do _this_  in particular using this app without having to learn too much and be stuck for hours. And it lists  the steps to perform and usually if it works you can be on your merry way. 

However not every app is known by these AI tools and sometimes you find that ChatGPT or Grok is not familiar with this app or software. I wish a lot of software had documentation that AI tools could take and use it to guide users without them having to contact app support or read FAQs.

With these AI tools it seems as if I have my own curated tutorial for the task at hand. The nice thing about this is that sometimes the owners/creators of the software, Adobe, Microsoft, Google, some obscure open source App you downloaded don't even know that users are asking ChatGPT how to use their software to perform tasks. Not particularly sure if this is a good thing, but hey it seems to work so far.
