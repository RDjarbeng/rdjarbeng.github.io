**[TechRxiv](https://www.techrxiv.org)**  is an open, moderated preprint server designed for sharing unpublished research in fields such as electrical engineering, computer science, and related technology disciplines. It was launched in 2020 by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** to facilitate rapid dissemination of research findings, encourage collaboration, and provide a platform for researchers to share early results before formal peer review and publication. 

Submissions to TechRxiv are **not peer-reviewed** but are screened for plagiarism and inappropriate content. It is a free, publicly accessible platform where authors can post their work without any fees, and readers can access it freely.

You can explore TechRxiv [here](https://www.techrxiv.org).

## How Does TechRxiv Relate to arXiv?

TechRxiv is similar to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) in that both are open-access preprint repositories allowing researchers to share their work before formal peer review. However, there are some important differences:

| **Feature**         | **TechRxiv**                             | **arXiv**                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Discipline Scope** | Focused on engineering and technology   | Covers physics, mathematics, computer science, biology, finance, and more. |
| **Provider**         | Managed by IEEE                        | Managed by Cornell University.           |
| **Launch Year**      | 2020                                   | 1991                                        |
| **Moderation**       | Screened for plagiarism and content     | Moderated for topical relevance and scholarly value. |
| **Peer Review**      | Not peer-reviewed                      | Not peer-reviewed                           |

While arXiv has a broader disciplinary scope, TechRxiv caters specifically to the engineering and technology community.

## Other Similar Preprint Repositories

There are several other preprint repositories tailored to specific disciplines or general research. Here are some notable ones:

- **[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org)**: For life sciences research.
- **[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org)**: For medical and health sciences.
- **[ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org)**: For chemistry-related research.
- **[engrXiv](https://engrxiv.org)**: Focused on engineering preprints.
- **[SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/)**: For social sciences.
- **[SSRN (Social Science Research Network)](https://www.ssrn.com)**: Multidisciplinary with a focus on social sciences.
- **[ViXra](http://vixra.org)**: An alternative to arXiv with multidisciplinary coverage, including unconventional research.

These repositories serve as platforms for researchers across various domains to share their work openly, fostering collaboration and early feedback from the academic community.

Sidenote: When I was writing this post some kind of glitch happened and the TechRxiv page loaded without the css taking us back to the 90s. This is such a rare occurence, of course I took a screenshot and added it beneath this postðŸ™‚.
