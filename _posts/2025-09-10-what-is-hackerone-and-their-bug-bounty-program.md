What on earth is a Bug Bounty? No it's not about hunting insects. If you are in the information security field the term might be familiar to you but if you're not this post will shed some light.  Many companies, especially in tech, offer bug bounty programs where they pay individuals for finding and reporting vulnerabilities or issues. These programs are designed to improve security and user experience and are usually posted on certain platforms with bug bounty programs such as _HackerOne_ or [_BugCrowdList_](https://www.bugcrowd.com/). In this post, we discuss one of these platforms, [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/). 
HackerOne is a leading hacker-powered security platform that connects organizations with a global community of over 2 million ethical hackers to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious exploitation HackerOne. Founded in 2012, it empowers over 1,200 companies—including GitHub, PayPal, and Uber—to secure digital assets through crowdsourced testing [HackerOne About](https://www.hackerone.com/about). The platform has facilitated over 500,000 bug discoveries, with one critical vulnerability reported hourly, saving organizations millions per critical fix prevented [HackerOne Impact](https://www.hackerone.com/impact).

### Practical Example: A Relatable Security Fix

Imagine you're shopping online and notice a website lets you change a product price by editing the URL (e.g., from $10 to $1) before checkout. In 2016, an ethical hacker using HackerOne found a similar flaw on Uber's platform, where a pricing vulnerability could have allowed users to manipulate ride fares. The hacker reported it, Uber fixed the issue by validating prices server-side, and the hacker earned a $10,000 bounty. This fix prevented potential financial losses and protected users, showing how HackerOne turns everyday discoveries into real security wins [HackerOne Case Studies](https://www.hackerone.com/case-studies). I used this example to illustrate how a bug bounty works without getting too technical. Sometimes it's also clear to make a distinction between security vulnerabilities and regular bugs on an app such as my [report to landingAI](https://rdjarbeng.com/agentic-object-detection-and-document-extraction-with-landing.ai/#bug-reporting-and-feedback-landingai-support) about their broken sign up button.

As a library, HackerOne hosts a directory of programs, from public initiatives like the Internet Bug Bounty to exclusive private programs [HackerOne Directory](https://www.hackerone.com/directory). In 2024, reported vulnerabilities rose by 9%, highlighting the platform’s [impact](https://www.hackerone.com/impact).

## The HackerOne Bug Bounty Program

HackerOne's bug bounty platform enables companies to launch programs where ethical hackers are rewarded for responsibly reporting security flaws in software, websites, apps, and other assets [HackerOne Bug Bounty](https://www.hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs). These programs complement traditional security measures, offering continuous testing without disrupting development [HackerOne Solutions](https://www.hackerone.com/solutions).

### How It Works

1. **Program Setup**: Organizations define scope (e.g., specific domains), rules (e.g., no denial-of-service attacks), and reward structures. HackerOne’s experts help customize programs to fit risk profiles [HackerOne Program Setup](https://www.hackerone.com/solutions/bug-bounty).
2. **Hacker Participation**: Researchers join via HackerOne, build skills through free training like Hacker101, and test in-scope assets ethically. They submit detailed vulnerability reports [HackerOne Hacker101](https://www.hackerone.com/hacker101).
3. **Reporting and Triage**: Submissions are validated by HackerOne’s triage team and forwarded to companies for remediation [HackerOne Triage](https://www.hackerone.com/solutions/triage).
4. **Rewards and Resolution**: Hackers earn bounties based on vulnerability severity (critical bugs can pay thousands), and companies gain insights to strengthen security [HackerOne Rewards](https://www.hackerone.com/solutions/bug-bounty).
