I just signed up using the option to "sign up with linkedIn" and noticed that my linkedIn profile isn't connected. Seems something is broken on your end. 

I also tried entering my details manually but the form wouldn't submit and the browser developer console shows an error in main.js

I didn't see a way to contact support but I hope this chat is monitored and an actual person will see this and fix it.
