If the embed option isn't showing for your Instagram posts, ==it's likely because the post or account is private, or you need to enable the "Website embeds" setting in your Instagram app under&#160;**Settings > Sharing and reuse**==, as this feature can be turned off by default for public accounts; ensure your account is public and you've toggled this setting on, then try getting the embed code again.

**For Your Own Posts:**

1. **Check Account Privacy**: Make sure your account is public, not private, as private content can't be embedded.
2. **Enable Embeds Setting**:

    - Go to your **Profile** on the Instagram app.
    - Tap the **Menu icon** (three lines) in the top right.
    - Select **Settings and privacy**.
    - Scroll down to "How others can interact with you" and tap **Sharing and reuse**.
    - Find **Website embeds** and toggle the switch to **On**
