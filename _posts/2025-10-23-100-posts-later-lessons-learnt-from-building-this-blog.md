Changes since the start:

Moved to SveltiaCMS

(add a graph of timeseries of published posts)

Changed from long url github.io to rdjarbeng.com

Added a personal page

500+ indexed pages on google (add screenshot)

Lessons:

Detailed does not always mean informative. Some technical posts here didn't receive much traffic

Adding thumbnails of posts is good, even if they take time to make

Writing takes time, even with AI

Sometimes AI is double work. Maybe righting things myself is a better approach

AI is good for generating tags, images, refinining titles. Cannot be trusted to create and edit posts without supervision

Sometimes your work helps others

Example landing AI, RuRa electricity announcement saving costs for electricity

Improvements to be made:

Homepage apparently is not very informative

Tags pages get more attention than posts

Getting guest authors

Improving backlinks

Best posts:

Trip to Uganda
