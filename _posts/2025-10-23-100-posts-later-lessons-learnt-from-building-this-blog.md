Changes since the start:

Content about the website:

One of the things that has changed is that I mostly include references directly in the post with the link to the external resource. I used to 'cite' them in the text and place them at the end of the post, but I felt that breaks the flow of reading for the web reader and doesn't usually help them find what they are looking for quickly; they have to scroll through the list of references to find the actual reference before finally clicking to see what they are looking for. On the upside it makes the post more compact. However one downside to this is that if the reader doesn't notice that the text they are currently reading is a link to a reference it may sound as if I'm just speaking from my personal experience. I've got the personal section of this website for that. Also sometimes I do a lot of research to before including certain content in a post, reading across many sources and then when I finally mention it in the post I include a link. I feel this  doesn't show the effort put into looking up sources for that particular post when all you see is a link; which the reader may or may not notice.

Technical about the website building:

Moved to SveltiaCMS

(add a graph of timeseries of published posts)

Changed from long url github.io to rdjarbeng.com

Added a personal page

500+ indexed pages on google (add screenshot)

Got problems with 'crawled-not indexed' and 'discovered-not indexed' though on google search console

Tags and category pages are ranked higher on google search instead of the home page or the navigation links.

Lessons:

Detailed does not always mean informative. Some technical posts here didn't receive much traffic

Adding thumbnails of posts is good, even if they take time to make

Writing takes time, even with AI

Sometimes AI is double work. Maybe righting things myself is a better approach

AI is good for generating tags, images, refining titles. Cannot be trusted to create and edit posts without supervision.

Top AI models:

Grok: good for refining text and is able to add current information in the proper context especially for posts where information needed is

Gemini (doing well with image generation especially with the text than grok)

Sometimes your work helps others

Example landing AI, RuRa electricity announcement saving costs for electricity

Improvements to be made:

Homepage apparently is not very informative, according to google. Been thinking of improving the homepage structure to reflect the different categories. I find that seeing a post on finance, then next another on air quality then another about AI spoils the experience. What are the chances that a user will be interested in all three. So if you look at it like a recommendation algorithm the closely related items should be grouped into a place where the user can browse their interests without navigating other posts which they have little interest in. I think this is also good for SEO

About page does not indicate a contact page at first glance

Tags pages get more attention than posts

Getting guest authors

Improving backlinks

Best posts:

Trip to Uganda

My favorites:

Banks in Rwanda, Letsile Tebogo
