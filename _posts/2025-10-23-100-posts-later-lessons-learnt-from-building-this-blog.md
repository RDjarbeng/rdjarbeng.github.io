Changes since the start:

Content about the website:

Made more long form content that is more than a 5 minute read. I think these posts allow me to cover more and are more informative. One good example is my post on a [decade by decade look at AI](https://rdjarbeng.com/a-chronological-look-at-ai-a-decade-by-decade-evolution/) which is sitting at 16 min read time. Ironically it is one of the posts that I would have liked to make longer but didn't have the time to add in all the extra details. If I had my way I could spend days writing about AI and it's hard to figure out which content to leave out. Because what to write is not just the issue what to leave out is also a big part of it. I must admit it's a bit painful leaving out a section of a piece you've worked on for days because you don't think it contributes to the story you're currently telling.

Sometimes too I end up changing a post so much that I'm not quite sure if the final version that was published is what I intended from the start. Especially when I use Gemini as an editor to brainstorm the drafts of post. If the wording in every paragraph is changed and the sentence structure differs but it's saying the same thing is it still the same post with different words or a new post with a different idea but similar to the first? It's giving the vibe of the [ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) so much

One of the things that has changed is that I mostly include references directly in the post with the link to the external resource. I used to 'cite' them in the text and place them at the end of the post, but I felt that breaks the flow of reading for the web reader and doesn't usually help them find what they are looking for quickly; they have to scroll through the list of references to find the actual reference before finally clicking to see what they are looking for. On the upside it makes the post more compact. However one downside to this is that if the reader doesn't notice that the text they are currently reading is a link to a reference it may sound as if I'm just speaking from my personal experience. I've got the personal section of this website for that. Also sometimes I do a lot of research to before including certain content in a post, reading across many sources and then when I finally mention it in the post I include a link. I feel this  doesn't show the effort put into looking up sources for that particular post when all you see is a link; which the reader may or may not notice.

Thumbnails for the posts have become more detailed with more information about the post highlighted on the thumbnail. I realise that the posts that feature me in the cover I have a tendency to strike a post where I am looking up. Just like that vegeta video where he's in the rain and staring up into the sky.

## Technical about the website building:

Moved to SveltiaCMS

(add a graph of timeseries of published posts)

Changed from long url github.io to rdjarbeng.com

Insert lighthouse reports are we green? How long to load?

Added a personal page

500+ indexed pages on google (add screenshot)

Got problems with 'crawled-not indexed' and 'discovered-not indexed' though on google search console

Tags and category pages are ranked higher on google search instead of the home page or the navigation links.

AI tools

AI man, AI - Gemini pro supercharged my content creation process, thumbnails and image creation for the covers

### Top AI models:

Grok: good for refining text and is able to add current information in the proper context especially for posts where information needed is about current events/trending news. Also good for verifying links but not 100% accurate. I've found some links to be dead after Grok assures me they are active. Hopefully it gets better eventually.

Gemini (doing well with image generation especially with the text than grok)

Sometimes I take the output from one model and give it to the other to criticize and work on improvements for the generated output.

Workflow for that AI work flow: Initial draft by me-> 1st draft post\* by AI model acting as a co-author -> Review by 2nd model acting as editor -> Update of draft post by me and 2nd AI model-> Final edits by senior Editor, Me

\*1st draft post, may go through many iterations and is usually the nth version, but it's usually the version that I find suitable to publish but could use improvement so it's sent to the editor.

Sometimes your work helps others. Landing AI post highlighted how I was able to notify them about the bug on their website,  RuRa electricity announcement saving costs for electricity, interior AI post helped someone create an appropriate layout for their room.

## Lessons:

Detailed does not always mean informative. Some technical posts here didn't receive much traffic

Adding thumbnails of posts is good, even if they take time to make.

Writing takes time, even with AI

Sometimes AI is double work. Maybe righting things myself is a better approach

AI is good for generating tags, images, refining titles. Cannot be trusted to create and edit posts without supervision.

## Improvements to be made:

Homepage apparently is not very informative, according to google. Been thinking of improving the homepage structure to reflect the different categories. I find that seeing a post on finance, then next another on air quality then another about AI spoils the experience. What are the chances that a user will be interested in all three. So if you look at it like a recommendation algorithm the closely related items should be grouped into a place where the user can browse their interests without navigating other posts which they have little interest in. I think this is also good for SEO

About page does not indicate a contact page at first glance

Tags pages get more attention than posts

Getting guest authors

Improving backlinks
