[Google officially announced](https://antigravity.google/blog/gemini-3-1-pro-in-google-antigravity) that **Gemini 3.1 Pro** is now available in Google Antigravity! This brings enhanced AI capabilities, better coding workflows, and a much smoother agentic experience directly into your development workspace.

## Spreading the Word
I was so excited about the release that I had to quickly share the announcement over on Twitter to let my network know that the wait is finally over:

## What You Need to Know

If you are a current user of Google Antigravity, **you might need to manually trigger an update** to ensure your client fetches the new model and its accompanying application patches. Remember that having an outdated version can prevent you from accessing these cutting-edge features.

Along with the addition of Gemini 3.1 Pro, Antigravity has rolled out several new features, improvements, fixes, and patches since the start of 2026. Because Antigravity is an agent-first IDE, its infrastructure is complex, and these recent fixes dramatically improve the everyday developer experience.

Some notable updates from the new release of antigravity version 1.19.5 include:

### **Browser Subagent Fix:**
 Antigravity utilizes an autonomous browser subagent that can navigate the web, bypass pop-ups, read DOM structures, and capture screenshots to gather context for your code. Earlier this year, this subagent sometimes struggled with heavy single-page applications (SPAs) or dynamic content loading. The recent patches have overhauled its DOM-parsing logic, drastically improving its stability when crawling complex websites and allowing the AI to research documentation with far fewer timeouts.

### **Stability and UI Improvements:**
Rendering massive contexts—such as conversational memory, rich markdown artifacts, and large file diffs—can be taxing on an IDE. The early 2026 updates introduced enhanced lazy-loading mechanisms and a memory-optimized rendering pipeline. The result is a much sleeker, more responsive user interface that doesn't freeze or drop frames even when the AI agent is processing enormous multi-file codebase edits in the background.

### **Fix for Windows Auto-updater:**
A critical but subtle bug was affecting Windows users where OS-level background task managers were interrupting Antigravity's silent update payload. This led to users being stranded on older versions without realizing it. The engineering team has now natively integrated the updater with Windows background services, ensuring future patches—like the rollout of Gemini 3.1 Pro—are delivered seamlessly without requiring manual intervention.
