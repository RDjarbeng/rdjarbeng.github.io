## Gemini

Gemini is good, others say they don't like the way Gemini talks to them. I have found that Gemini forgets less than other models and is less likely to erase/forget to include a sizeable part of an essay you are editing unlike some other models I won't mention(looking at you ChatGPT)

## ChatGPT

They say ChatGPT from OpenAI 'talks to me nicely'. Now it is of this author's opinion that ChatGPT is gratuitous, people-pleasing, goody-two-shoes who likes to assure you that you are absolutely right, while leading you on in paths of delusion. It is also prone to hallucination and likes to invent stuff out of thin air. In essence it behaves like it doesn't have a spine and follows wherever it is led. Of course until you give it a prompt that violates it's own rules but apart from that it's cool. But I must admit that it has been very instrumental in leading the current hype for LLMs and AI and it has been very useful for certain tasks. It's cordial and people-pleasing attitude also makes it easy to have conversations. Some people I have spoken to have said they prefer to use it for brainstorming instead.

## Grok:

I have found that Grok is good at tasks that require context (such as a post about the current approval ratings of politicians) and can also work with up to date data without loosing it's train of thought. For content that requires verification of information it is also good at retrieving information of the internet to enrich it's ideas.

Author note: Author uses Grok 3 and 4 and hasn't really noticed much difference in the answers but finds that Grok 4's answers are a little longer and usually includes reasonable alternatives instead of sticking to one answer. It seems aware of the fact that it could be wrong and admits this but it's also sure in the information it has provided. Compared to ChatGPT you can say that is If I was building a system whose performance depended on the data it was currently being fed in real-time then I would choose Grok. An application of this is for summary of posts on a news website or of understanding tweets and what's trending. I suppose that's why it's used on Twitter/X or is that a cause and effect and I'm analyzing it wrong

Meta AI: Hey Guys forget about me

## Claude

Claude from anthropic is that one guy who doesn't really have any haters except for ChatGPT, he does what he needs to do and doesn't usually refuse requests. An all round chill guy yet he has a problem with rate limits and I have to wait till 2pm for his rate limit to reset so he can write his part of the story.

## Copilot

Used to be a general not so bad model. Now it's most likely a ChatGPT wrapper using one of the models from OpenAI ever since that Microsoft and OpenAI parttnership. Was supposed to be a big deal since it's directly present in Windows but is very obscure now and hardly talked about. Don't know what it's good at now used to be great at image generation back in the day thanks to bing image generator. Could make a comeback or not

## Deepseek

The new player in the game. Everyone starts talking about China when they are using deepseek. Some security concerns from this one but it's an all round general model. It's a bit of an outlier since it's not even made by an AI company and claims to be open source unlike the closed source models from openAI and the rest, one of the first to introduce reasoning models that think before executing. Only here because it caused such a stir on launch at how  it was possible to train LLMs without spending billions. Surprisingly can solve some problems that the other models have failed at. A bit of a wildcard with it's own surprises. 

Qwen, perplexity, Mistral unfortunately were not invited blame ChatGPT he had the guest list
