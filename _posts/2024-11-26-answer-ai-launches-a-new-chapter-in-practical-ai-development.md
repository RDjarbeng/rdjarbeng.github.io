A groundbreaking AI venture has emerged with the launch of Answer.AI, a novel R&D laboratory founded by Jeremy Howard and Eric Ries with $10 million in funding from Decibel VC. This initiative represents a fresh approach to artificial intelligence development, focusing on practical applications rather than pursuing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## Leadership and Vision

Jeremy Howard, the founding CEO and co-founder of fast.ai, brings over 30 years of machine learning expertise, including the development of ULMFiT, a methodology now fundamental to modern language models like ChatGPT and Gemini. Eric Ries, serving as founding director, contributes his expertise in lean startup methodology and sustainable business development.

## Core Mission and Approach

Answer.AI distinguishes itself through:

**Research Focus**

The lab concentrates on leveraging existing AI models rather than developing new foundation models, targeting practical applications that can benefit everyday users.

**Team Structure**

The organization will operate as a fully-remote team of deep-tech generalists, emphasizing skill and creativity over traditional credentials.

**Development Philosophy**

Answer.AI adopts an iterative approach, solving smaller problems first while building toward larger goals. This methodology mirrors Edison's historical approach to harnessing electricity.

## Future Impact

The venture aims to democratize AI access through commercial products and services, creating a sustainable model where profitability and societal benefit align. By focusing on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains, Answer.AI seeks to expand the AI market while maintaining ethical considerations and practical data ethics at its core.

_The original announcement was made on December 12,2023, which makes this post a bit late to the party._
