title: "I can't see you in Fog: A mobile scenario for low visibility driving"
image: ''
layout: post
---
If I was afraid to cross a foggy road because I would not be seen by oncoming cars is there anything that can be done? Zebra crossing won't save me from getting hit if the driver can't see it.

If I was a driver how would I want to be told that there is a pedestrian on the road in front of me when I'm driving down a road with low visibility.

One possible solution:

Most people carry mobile phones. Is there a way that a person's mobile phone can talk to a car and make it very clear that a person is standing on the road? Does this technology exist?

Ironically, many blame mobile phones as the reason people get hit on the road because of distractions. Could the problem actually become a solution?

What security risks does this pose when it comes to sharing my location with a fleet of cars? Would this stand the test of time?
