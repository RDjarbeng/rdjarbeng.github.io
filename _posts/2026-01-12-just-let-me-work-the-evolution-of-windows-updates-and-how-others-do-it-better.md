The answer is no. Of course you can't borrow my laptop/pc for  a few minutes while I'm working. Can you remind me tomorrow? No, don't. You'll remind me anyway, _sigh_, well the answer is still no, Microsoft. Find a way to do what you need without inconveniencing me. Okay you want to do it at 2am when I'm not using my PC, what are you some kind of stalker? Who even has their laptop on at that ungodly hour. It will only take a few minutes. Will I be able to continue from where I left off? No? So I'll have to start all over again but you promise it will be quick. So you can't do this without interrupting my work. I see. Hmm, let me think about it, NO!!. The answer is still no.

In this post we look at the evolution of windows update whilst comparing it to other update mechanisms in other operating systems such as MacOs and Linux based systems.
