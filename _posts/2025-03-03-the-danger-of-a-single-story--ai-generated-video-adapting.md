Witness an innovative AI-generated video adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâ€™s iconic TED Talk, _"The Danger of a Single Story."_ The script was crafted by ChatGPT and brought to life by an AI avatar using [D-IDâ€™s video generation tool](https://www.d-id.com/). This project was created about a year ago, offering an early look at the capabilities of generative AI. I would love to see what the current state of the art is for AI video generation.

While this technology showcases impressive potential, itâ€™s not without flaws. Lip synchronization and emotional expression remain limited, revealing areas for growth. Still, the possibilities are vastâ€”especially for creating instructional and training videos where emotional depth is less critical.

As Mrs. Adichie warns, we must avoid judging all AI-generated content by this single example. To do so would be to fall into the very trap of a "single story." This is just one glimpse into an evolving field.

A heartfelt thanks to Denis Musinguzi, Nathaniel Nyakotey, Okemawo Obadofin, and many friends for their insightful feedback, as well as Yanyan Wang for her [original post](https://lnkd.in/drHUGkhs) that inspired this exploration. Watch the video, explore the tools, and dive into the TED Talk belowâ€”your comments are welcome!
