title: Money Transfers Doing Two Things At Once
image: ''

Most money transfers try to do 2 things at once, transfer money and convert the currency.

Why not focus on just a transfer? Why are accounts not multicurrency by default. If you send me $5 I should receive $5, but the bank decides to convert it to my account type. Who asked for this? Leave my $5, or 5 Euros, pounds where it is. I will do the conversion later.

Is multicurrency accounts such a big problem in 2025, what's the bottleneck is it inertia or an actual barrier?

Complaints then others will be using other currencies. Well they'll convert eventually, but there is no advantage in instant conversion.

Why do you have to have a currency specified on an account?

Why have a USD and EURO account?
