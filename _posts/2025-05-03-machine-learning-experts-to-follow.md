Looking for inspiration in the field of Machine Learning? Here are my top picks for experts whose work is shaping the future of AI. 

## My Top Recommendations

- **Andrew Ng**  
![Andrew Ng presenting](/assets/images/andrew_ng_syd.jpg "Andrew Ng")
  Co-founder of [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) and [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), Andrew Ng is a pioneer in machine learning. His [Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng) are a must for anyone starting out or looking to deepen their understanding.  Before they were only available on Coursera and used MATLAB, now those courses are also available on YouTube and use python .
  _Why follow?_ Practical, accessible, and transformative insights into AI.
- **Lex Fridman**  
  An AI researcher and professor at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), Lex is best known for his [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) (formerly _The Artificial Intelligence Podcast_). He dives into AI, tech, and science with leading minds.  
  _Why follow?_ Thought-provoking discussions and a knack for breaking down complex topics.

- **Andreas Müller**  
  A core developer of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), a cornerstone machine learning library, Andreas is also the author of [_Introduction to Machine Learning with Python_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/).  
  _Why follow?_ Deep technical expertise and practical guidance for Python-based ML.
- **Emmanuel Ameisen**  
  Co-founder of a machine learning startup and author of [_Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/), Emmanuel focuses on turning ML ideas into real-world solutions.  
  _Why follow?_ Actionable advice for building and deploying ML applications.
- **Jean de Dieu Nyandwi**  
  Author of the [Complete Machine Learning Package](https://github.com/Nyandwi/machine_learning_complete), a GitHub repository with over 3,900 stars 🌟. Jean is an avid learner and content creator who explains Python and AI concepts with clarity.  
  _Why follow?_ Beginner-friendly tutorials and open-source contributions.

## Why These Experts Stand Out

I’m a huge fan of Andrew Ng and Lex Fridman (okay, maybe a bit biased 😅), but their ability to make complex AI topics accessible and engaging is unmatched. Whether you're new to machine learning or a seasoned pro, their content—along with the work of Andreas, Emmanuel, and Jean—offers something valuable for everyone.

## Paying It Forward

Someone once shared a list of AI experts to follow, and now I’m paying it forward ✅. These individuals are driving innovation and sharing knowledge that can help you stay ahead in the fast-evolving world of machine learning.
