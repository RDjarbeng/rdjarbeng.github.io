Here's a photo I took when I interrupted some birds. This was around sunset and it looks like they were on a date of some sort  just chilling at the dnd of the day. Then I showed up with my camera ready to capture this romantic scene. They don't look happy about the paparazzi.

Aww so cute isn't it. 

Not if you're cynical about love ðŸ™„. This seems to be an appropriate reaction.
