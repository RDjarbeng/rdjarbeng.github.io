I stumbled upon this serene moment the other evening, right around sunset in Kigali.  This was around sunset and it looks like they were on a date of some sort  just chilling at the end of the day. They stand on a ledge overlooking the Special Economic Zone, gazing into the horizon like they were lost in some avian rom-com.
Then I show up with my camera ready to capture this romantic scene.ðŸ“¸ Click. They didn't look happy to see me ,the ultimate paparazzo. They shot me the side-eyeâ€”clearly not thrilled about the intrusion.

Aww, so cute, right? The kind of heart-melting scene that makes you believe in soulmates, even for sparrows.

Not if you're cynical about love ðŸ™„. This meme captures my initial reaction perfectly: sometimes, even the sweetest moments deserve a healthy dose of skepticism

 I left them to continue their date whilst I went back to work. Happy to have disturbed their little date. They remained on the ledge even as I walked away.

It got me reflecting on a line from [Desiderata](https://www.desiderata.com/desiderata.html):

> Neither be cynical about love;  
> for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,  
> it is as perennial as the grass.

_PS: While writing this post I found something interesting. The singular form of paparazzi is paparazzo. Paparazzi is a plural noun of Italian origin, referring to intrusive, independent photographers who pursue celebrities. While paparazzo is the masculine singular form, and paparaza is the feminine singular, they are rarely used in English compared to the pervasive plural form, paparazzi. (according to Google Gemini)_
