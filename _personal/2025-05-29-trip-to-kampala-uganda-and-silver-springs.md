This post is incomplete. Will update this draft later

I have always wanted to travel to Uganda. So when Abdul told me he was headed to Kampala for a Toastmasters district conference I seized the opportunity to tag along.  In this post I will outline my trip to Kampala earlier in March 2025.

Let's start from the beginning. The journey was done by bus and took  approximately 11 hours to reach Kampala from Kigali; 2 hours to reach the Rwanda-Uganda border, the rest from the border to Kampala. We used the Trinity bus service the buses were nice and we had no issues with the buses in general except another issue which I'll speak about later.

A taste of Pilau (a bit similar to jollof rice)

A hearty breakfast at the Silver Springs hotel. Compliments to the chef.

At the break of the conference there was actually a vendor selling pictures of people taken randomly throughout the event. Talk about the entrepreneurship spirit. Here's one photo that captured me whilst I was unaware.

This was taken shortly after checkout from the hotel. That sculpture of the president was ... interesting.

I couldn't believe it was over and we were headed back to Kigali. The sights of Kampala, the food, the people, the food. I said food twice didn't I.

The trip back to Kigali was in the day. We left Kampala some time before 8am.

On the bright side we get to see attractions on the road we didn't see earlier when we passed at night. I'll add some of the photos I took on the way back to Kigali. Most of the places we passed outside of the towns were mostly green fields as far as the eyes could see with occasional herds of cows.

I like this photo. Taken somewhere in Lwengo, after passing Bulimbale

Cows, long horn cows

A rest stop after some hours in the bus. Still in Uganda.
