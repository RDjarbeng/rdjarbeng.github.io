In Kigali, Rwanda one of the major forms of transport is using a motor taxi. Here you can find them riding along most roads or parked at a corner waiting for passengers.

Here's a photo I took at a bus-stop showing the bikes on the move in Kigali.

For foreigners from other African countries the bike riders have been known to increase prices especially once they realize you do not speak the local language, Kinyarwanda. Partly for this reason I have been brushing up on my Kinyarwanda skills to be able to navigate Kigali as easily as a local.

However there are some nuances when it comes to blending in.

I once told a bike rider I was going to Kimironko in my best Kinyarwanda hoping to blend in as a local. He paused looked at me and said, 'Where are you going?' in English. Attempt to blend in failed. We continued the negotiations in English. I resigned myself, knowing I was likely to pay a higher fare to my destination.

Apparently the locals in Kigali do not pronounce K-I as Kim, like the name, but something more like _chim,&#32;_like chimney I suppose or _tsi&#32;_like... couldn't find a suitable word in English.  Talk about a dead giveaway the moment I open my mouth.

At least that's one Kinyarwanda lesson that I'll remember. 

In case you are noticing that Kigali and Kinyarwanda start with K-I and wondering whether the pronunciation applies, yes, yes it does. They usually say _Tsi_-gali city and _Chi_-nyarwanda although the difference is not easily noticeable to someone who is used to speaking English. I suppose that's one way to blow your cover as foreigner in Kigali, sorry, in Tsi-gali city.
