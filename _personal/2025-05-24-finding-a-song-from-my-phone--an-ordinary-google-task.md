This was my method for finding a song from a video I watched on my phone. Here I used the split screen feature to open 2 apps at the same time. I open the Google app as one of them and get to the find a song feature. Then I open the second app, in this case Youtube where I was playing one video with a catchy tune.

It went something like this: _'Guitar tune....Something so out of the ordinary, I want you laying me down... guitar tune'_

So now I have Google open in one window and Youtube open in another. Then I play the video in one window and select the find a song feature so they play together. If successful Google usually provides links to the song, a youtube video link in this case. Sometimes it gives you possible recommendations of a list of songs it thinks could be playing.

Here's a video of the steps I used.

Found out the song name is 'Ordinary' by Alex Warren. Sweet. Specifically: Alex Warren: Ordinary |The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. I'll try and include the link for that below.

Thanks to Google 'Find a song' I can now free myself from wondering what song that was. However it doesn't always work out as you can see in the video below. For this, the video was one I took personally at one event, "Founder's Friday at Norrsken' in Kigali. Google was not able to find the song. The saxophonist was playing his cover of a famous song so I can't really blame Google because it wasn't exactly the same thing.

By the way that song the saxophonist was playing was 'Soweto'
