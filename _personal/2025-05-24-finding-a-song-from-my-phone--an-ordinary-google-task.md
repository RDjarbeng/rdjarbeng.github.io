This was my method for finding a song from a video I watched on my phone. Here I used the split screen feature to open 2 apps at the same time. I open the Google app as one of them and get to the find a song feature. Google keeps changing the layout but it was underneath the search bar for me (see screenshot) .

Here's a a screenshot of the 'find a song feature' in action.

Then I open the second app, in this case Youtube where I was playing one video with a catchy tune.

It went something like this: _'Guitar tune....Something so out of the ordinary, I want you laying me down... guitar tune'_

So now I have Google open in one window and Youtube open in another. Then I play the video in one window and select the find a song feature so they play together. If successful Google usually provides links to the song, a youtube video link in this case. Sometimes it gives you possible recommendations of a list of songs it thinks could be playing.

Here's a video of the steps I used.

Found out the song name is 'Ordinary' by Alex Warren. Sweet. It turns out the Youtube shorts used this audio specifically: Alex Warren: Ordinary The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. That has a stronger/louder  instrumental at the end which is missing in the official video.  I'll include that particular video below.

Thanks to Google 'Find a song' I can now free myself from wondering what song that was. However it doesn't always work out as you can see in the video below. For this, the video was one I took personally at one event, "Founder's Friday at Norrsken' in Kigali. Google was not able to find the song. Doesn't always work. However in Google's defense,  the saxophonist was playing his cover of a famous song so I can't really blame Google because it wasn't exactly the same thing.

By the way that song the saxophonist was playing was '[Victony & Tempoe - Soweto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPBRGWUgQsA)'
