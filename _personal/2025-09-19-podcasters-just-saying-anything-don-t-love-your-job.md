"Don't love your job, job your love"

What's that supposed to mean? ðŸ™„

Podcast host: "I love that!"

Sometimes I think podcast equipment is too cheap nowadays. Every opinion is out on the internet.

Here's one reaction that I found funny of people just continuing the trend. Fighting silliness with silliness.

Don't waste your time, time your waste ðŸ¤£
