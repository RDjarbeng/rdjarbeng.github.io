## 📍Where are we?

Let's start with the basics: we’re on Planet Earth, in Africa, in Rwanda, in Kigali, and finally, we arrive at the Gasabo district.

Gasabo is a district in Kigali, and “Gasabo” (also known as "agaseke") means "basket" in the local language, Kinyarwanda.

## The Story Behind the Basket

Each district in Kigali has a symbol, and the district of Gasabo chose a basket. To celebrate this, they decided to place a giant basket on top of a building, making it a unique and memorable landmark in Kigali. It’s unlikely that you'll find a similar building with a basket on top anywhere else in the world.

This distinctive feature not only represents the cultural heritage of the area but also adds a touch of charm and character to the district.

## A Unique Landmark

The giant basket is a pretty unique landmark in Kigali. It’s an interesting blend of modern architecture and traditional symbolism, creating a visual representation of the district's identity.
