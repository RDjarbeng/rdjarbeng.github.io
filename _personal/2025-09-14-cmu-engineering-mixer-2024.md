I still remember this mixer event on the CMU campus. 
So nice to meet new people from other departments across campus.

It's interesting to meet PhD students and discuss with them how they got into their PhDs. Also realized that age is not a  complete variable for determining if someone is in a PhD. Met young people who are in a PhD program, met much older students who are in their bachelors.

Hope to finish this post soon.
