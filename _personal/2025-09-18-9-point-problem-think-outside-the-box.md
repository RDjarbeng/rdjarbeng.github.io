For a grid of 9 points arranged in a 3x3 pattern, can you connect all the points with 4 straight lines?

Here are the rules:
\*  You can't lift your pen of the paper or mouse if you're on a screen; it must be continuous. 

\* You can't do a back and forth motion and count it as one line. 

\* No curves allowed

\* \* \*

\* \* \*

\* \* \*

Good luck!
