Here we take a look at some songs that were not initially released as standalone but were made for a purpose. For example a soundtrack for a movie that eventually became popular, also adding video game songs that surpassed expectations and became mainstream. To narrow our search we are gonna set the loose requirement that the video/song should have at least 1 million views on Youtube or a million streams on spotify.

## Sugar - You are my candy girl

Surprised that this wasn't a song released in the regular way yet still hit the charts.

## Valhalla calling me - Miracle of sound

Stars are shining - end of black panther

La Da Dee - Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs 2
