I'm trying to start a series on interesting videos on the internet that I found ... interesting from way back. 

We're starting off with Nike the last game. I cannot understand how this video will not kindled a fire for football for anyone who hasn't watched it.

I can't believe it's been almost 10 years since this video was released in December 2015. Ah the memories of being shown this by my friends back then. In those times all the players shown were, could say, in their prime.
Who could stop Ronaldo or hold a midfield like Iniesta? Good times! (instructions: Do a list of what the status of each player shown in the video is now at the current date, retired, still playing? )
After 10 years I would like to know the impact that it has made.
(instructions: What was the initial response to the video, does it still hold in 2025? Was it considered a good video?)

(Instructions: I am interested in the story behind this. What was the main idea? Which studio animated this? Did the players actually voice the characters?)

The way Rooney was abducted still makes me chuckle every time. Neymar's speed dribble at the end was chef's kiss. Those clones really needed some personality. 
The video reminds me of one other football series Supa strikas and has the feel of Strika land about it.

This was a really well thought out video. I enjoyed watching it and will enjoy rewatching it

At present It currently has more than 200M views on Youtube; 

202,775,176  views to be precise at the time of writing this post. For some reason I thought I would find it on Nike's channel but instead found it on this Youtube channel, [mycoolvideos](https://www.youtube.com/@mycoolvideos). 

 Featuring

- Cristiano Ronaldo
- Zlatan Ibrahimovic
- Neymar Jr
- Wayne Rooney
- Andres Iniesta
- David Luiz (add all)

There's no greater danger than playing it safe
Here is the video below for nostalgia.
