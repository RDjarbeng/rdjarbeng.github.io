The book literally says lamentations which in simple term cans be called complaining. My first time reading this book I was wondering why would anyone even add this to the bible

It starts off with some very unpleasant ideas and continues in despair. 

> How lonely sits the city that was full of people! How like a widow is she, who was great among the nations! The princess among the provinces has become a slave! \~ Lamentations 1:1

Not something one would expect to find in the bible when you are looking for an encouraging word. For 2 chapters there is no encouraging word about God or hope for his children.

However in chapter 3 there is one big turning point with a big BUT. 


**_Yet hope returns when I remember this one thing_**: The LORD's unfailing love and mercy still continue, Fresh as the morning, as sure as the sunrise. \~Lamentations 3:21 [GNT](https://www.bible.com/bible/68/LAM.3.21-24.GNT)

> The New King James Version (NKJV) says:
> 
> This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness. “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “Therefore I hope in Him!” The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, To the soul who seeks Him. It is good that one should hope and wait quietly For the salvation of the LOR It is good for a man to bear The yoke in his youth. Let him sit alone and keep silent, Because God has laid it on himD. \~Lamentations 3:21-28 [NKJV](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/LAM.3.21-28)

From verse 21 the scene changes from despair to hope.
