So the Amahoro  stadium renovations are finally complete and I made this video to highlight the completed stadium. 

The stadium hosts football matches and some events in Rwanda such as the presidential inauguration. Located in Remera, Kigali the stadium is an iconic landmark and looks like a basket with it's design. It could be related to my earlier [post](https://rdjarbeng.com/personal/gasabo_basket/) about baskets in Kigali.

Also featured is the smaller venue, the BK arena which hosts Basketball games and other events.
