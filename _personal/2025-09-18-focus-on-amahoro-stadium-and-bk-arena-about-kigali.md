The long-awaited renovations of Amahoro Stadium are finally complete! To celebrate, I put together this quick video showcasing the revamped venue in all its glory. It's a must-see for anyone who's ever wondered about that massive, basket-shaped landmark dominating Kigali's skyline.

_(If you haven't seen it in person, trust me—it's even more impressive up close.)_

## A Quick Rundown

- **Location**: Nestled in Remera, Kigali, this 45,000-seat powerhouse is Rwanda's premier sports and events hub.
- **What Goes Down Here**: Home to thrilling football matches for local teams like APR FC and Rayon Sports, plus high-profile events like the presidential inauguration. It's not just a stadium; it's a symbol of national pride.
- **Design Vibes**: That unique basket-inspired architecture? It's a nod to Rwanda's rich weaving traditions. If you're into that, check out my earlier [post on baskets in Gasabo District](https://rdjarbeng.com/personal/gasabo_basket/)—it ties in perfectly.

Also in the video, I squeezed in a nod to the neighboring **BK Arena**, Rwanda's go-to spot for basketball showdowns and concerts. It's smaller but packs a punch for indoor events.

## Watch the Video

Dive into the details with my video of the Amahoro stadium from the outside.

Unfortunately I don't have a video of the inside of the stadium but I hope to create a post for that soon.

**Soundtrack Shoutout**: Bumping in the background is [3Kota - Si Yab Tumpa (Official Audio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qL4BmTQkrc). Pure energy—fits the stadium's electric atmosphere!
