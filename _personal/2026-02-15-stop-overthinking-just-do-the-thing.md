There's this video on 'Doing the Thing' that I like so much so I'm gonna share it with you. [Chris Williamson](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisWillx) shares a perspective on productivity and procrastination.

The video captures a list of things that are _not_ doing the thing:

*   Preparing to do the thing.
*   Scheduling time to do the thing.
*   Making a to-do list for the thing.
*   Telling people you're going to do the thing.
*   Messaging friends who may or may not be doing the thing.
*   Writing a banger tweet about how you're going to do the thing.
*   Hating on yourself for not doing the thing.
*   Hating on other people who have done the thing.
*   Hating on the obstacles in the way of you doing the thing.
*   Fantasizing about all of the adoration you'll receive once you do the thing.
*   Reading about how to do the thing.
*   Reading about how other people did the thing.
*   Reading this post.
