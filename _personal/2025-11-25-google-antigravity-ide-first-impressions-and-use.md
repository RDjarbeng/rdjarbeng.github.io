antigravity IDE- tested, makes a lot of unnecessary changes especially white space

Can create python scripts that do bulk tasks. Seems to prefer this. Actually inferred my python version and run this.

Advantages, it doesn't lag like the copilot vscode and doesn't complain when it has to do work across multiple files. Seems to understand the file structure and can infer what type of project it is. For instance I never told it that my website was a jekyll one deployed on Github pages but it was able to infer this. Probably based on the config and the files present in the repository

Doesn't seem to know when it breaks something and doesn't seem to have access to the terminal output to see errors unless I tell it.
