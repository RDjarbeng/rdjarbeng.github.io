Let's look at the typical experience of getting a haircut in Kigali.

For barber shops in Kigali, some have combined with a hair salon so you may find ladies braiding hair.

After the cut there is the washing, which you can opt out off. I didn't know you could just choose not to wash, sometimes I could be in a hurry and have to sit through a wash. No more. For me I like to spend the least amount of time, and if you're like me you just want to be in and out quickly.

## How barbers cut vs how some customers like it

Beard: It is not a straight line, it's not supposed to be smooth

Ccups: Always trying to make a curve for the shape of the lineup. Meanwhile we like it straight like an African arrow.

Lineup: They have the tendency to send the hairline backwards, which is atrocious in itself. Perhaps they want your forehead to be exposed
