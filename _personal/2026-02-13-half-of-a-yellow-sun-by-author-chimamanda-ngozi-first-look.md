I finally picked up a copy of *Half of a Yellow Sun* by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The blurb at the back doesn't give away too many spoilers, but I am incredibly curious to find out why this specific novel was crowned the **Women's Prize for Fiction 'Winner of Winners'**.

## What It's About - From the Blurb behind the book

Set in 1960s Nigeria, the story promises to follow three intersecting lives during a tumultuous time:
*   **Ugwu**, a houseboy for a university professor.
*   **Olanna**, a privileged woman who leaves Lagos for a simpler life with her lover.
*   **Richard**, a shy Englishman infatuated with Olanna's twin sister.

From what I understand, these characters are thrown together during the horrific Nigerian Civil War, where their loyalties and relationships are tested in unimaginable ways.

## Why I'm Reading It
I find the title interesting and also because I think it will be a good read.
I'm looking forward to diving into this masterpiece and seeing if it lives up to the immense praise. I'll report back once I've turned the final page.
