Have you ever had a bad haircut abroad? For my haircuts in Kigali I've kept the same barber for more than 3 years. Here is one of my favorite cuts he made.

## Challenges of Getting a Haircut in Kigali

Usually the problem faced by foreigners to Rwanda is that the barbers don't know their preferences when it comes to giving a haircut. For me, before I visit a barber I usually prefer one that someone has recommended. For some reason sitting at the mercy of a stranger with the power to wreak havoc on your hair is not something most people look forward to.

If a barber assumes you want your hair styled similar to most people around him you might not be so happy with that assumption.  Particularly if you have a different way of styling your hair where you're from. Or worse if they don't take your input at all. 

Personal complaints include: shifting the hairline to expose more of the forehead, trimming away parts of the beard. (this one is particularly painful  when it's a part of the beard that I have tried for months to grow), shaving off the beard outright ðŸ™„ ... I could keep going.

One of the challenges stems from a communication barrier between Kinyarwanda and English. You might find the barber doesn't understand what you mean or misinterprets what you wanted.

## My Worst Haircut Experience

Here is an experience from one of my first haircuts in Kigali. The barber pointed at my beard and asked me one word, 'Cut?'. I looked at his fingers in the mirror and they looked like they were tracing the outline of my beard. So silly me assumed by 'cut' he meant he wanted to shape the beard and probably trim it in a more presentable manner. So with a smile  I said yes.ðŸ˜• Instant mood change as he shaved off the entire right face of my beard and my smile disappeared. To my horror I now understood what he meant.
I found a picture that I think represents the look on my face then.

Anyway, the damage had already been done and considering the hair already removed there was little that I could do to save this situation. I'm guessing he could tell the atmosphere in the room had shifted so he looked at me in the mirror for confirmation or perhaps as a way of apologizing. So I had to tell him to remove the whole beard so he can _finish the job_ and I leave in shame. I want to say, having a beard you've grown for years taken from you in a matter of seconds just feels wrong. Walking back home my face felt strange, even naked. Needless to say I didn't go back there after that experience.

## Finding the Right Barber

Then I met Danny. He was the first barber in Kigali to ask me for a haircut style before he started. He usually says, 'Boss, show me design'. Well he speaks more words than my last barber but now he's asking me for stuff.  In Ghana the barbers usually have pictures of different hairstyles plastered all around the shop and you just point out the cut you want. (I'll insert an example below)

![Barber shop sample haircuts in a grid](/assets/images/barber_shop_samples.jpg "Barber shop sample haircuts From https://www.amazon.com/Laminated-Hairstyles-Painting-Pictures-08%C3%9712inch-Framed/dp/B0CN74BRW3?th=1")

Danny's shop didn't have any of those pictures. Well now what do I do. Think... I take out my phone and search something around haircuts for men and show him an example.  Now Danny is not done yet. He points out that the beard style in the sample I showed him  is very different from my current beard. This guy actually cares about my beard this time ðŸ¤”. So I tell him to just smooth out my current beard (the little I had managed to grow backðŸ˜…) . Now let's go. 

He does the haircut as close to the image as he can. In the sample there is a lot of hair up top. So I tell him to make mine lower and he does this. Finally a barber I can work with in Kigali.

Smiles are back ðŸ™‚

Key takeaways when going for a haircut in Kigali you can bring reference photos, or learn basic Kinyarwanda phrases for haircuts and use recommendations from others when picking a hair salon for a cut.
