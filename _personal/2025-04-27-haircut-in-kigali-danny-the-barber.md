For my haircuts in Kigali I've kept the same barber for more than 3 years. Here is one of my favorite cuts he made.

Usually the problem faced by foreigners is that the barbers  don't know their preferences when it comes to giving a haircut. Some people might not even feel comfortable trusting someone new to cut their hair for various reasons. Some people have barbers back home whom they've formed strong bonds with and can't just transfer that to a new guy. 

For me, to go to a barber I usually prefer one that someone has recommended; usually because I liked their haircut and asked them. Sitting at the mercy of a stranger with the power to wreak havoc on my hair is not something most people accept easily. It gives the feeling shown in this picture:

If a barber assumes you want it like the way the typical Rwandans cut their hair you might not be e so happy about that. ðŸ˜• Particularly if you have a different way of styling your hair where you're from. 

Some of my personal complaints include: shifting the hairline to expose more of the forehead, trimming away parts of the beard. (this one is painful particularly when it's a part of the beard that I have tried for months to grow ðŸ§”), shaving off the beard outright ðŸ™„ ... I could go on

Usually this stems from a communication barrier between Kinyarwanda and English. You might find the barber doesn't understand what you mean or misinterprets what you wanted.

Here is an experience from one of my first haircuts in Kigali. The barber pointed at my beard and asked one word, 'Cut?'. I looked at his fingers in the mirror and they looked like they were tracing the outline of my beard. So silly me assumed by 'cut' he meant he wanted to shape the beard and probably trim it in a more presentable manner. So with a smile â˜º I said yes.

ðŸ˜• Instant mood change as he shaved off the entire right face of my beard. No more smiles. To my horror I discovered what he meant now.
I found a picture that I think represents the look on my face then.

Anyway, the damage had already been done and given the nature of the cut there was little that could be done to save this situation. I'm guessing he could tell the atmosphere in the room had shifted so he looked at me in the mirror for confirmation or perhaps apologi. So I had to tell him to remove the whole beard so he can finish the job and I leave in shame. I want to say, having a beard you've grown for years taking from you in a matter of seconds just feels wrong. Walking back home my face felt strange, even naked. ðŸ˜¶Needless to say I didn't go back there.

Anyway, then I met Danny. He was the first barber in Kigali to ask me for a haircut style before he started. He usually says, 'Boss, show me design'. Wow he speaks more words than my last barber bur now he's asking me for stuff. First time this happened I started looking around the shop, left right, up as if I was watching some invisible bird fly around. He must have been confused ðŸ˜•. Well, in Ghana the barbers usually have pictures of different hairstyles plastered all around the shop. So you normally just point out the style you want. Danny's shop didn't have any of those pictures. Well now what do I do. Think... I take out my phone and search something around haircuts for men, go to images, scroll and find one I like and show to him.  Now let's go. Danny is not done yet. He points out that the beard style in the sample I showed him  is very different from my current beard. This guy actually cares about my beard this time ðŸ¤”. So I tell him to just smooth out my current beard (the little I had managed to grow backðŸ˜…) . Now let's go. 

He does the haircut as close to the image as he can. In the sample there is a lot of hair up top. So I tell him to make mine lower and he does this. Finally a barber I can work with in Kigali.
