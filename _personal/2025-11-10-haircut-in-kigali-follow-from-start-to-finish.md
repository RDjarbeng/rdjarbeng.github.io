The start

I've let my beard grow more than usual today. And my hairline could use some work. Hoping to get that Spiderman, Myles Morales straight cut.

My barber doesn't have a beard but I know he's gonna respect the outline of the beard and shape it up nicely, unlike my unfortunate beard experience during my first haircut in Kigali 😩

I remember this ine haircut that left me almost speechless

But nowadays I rarely have a bad haircut because my barber understands me now and what I need. I hink.

First I wait because there are 2 people ahead of me. Texted the barber before coming but forget about appointment.

The process, controlled chaos

The end, how did he do. Hope this isn't a cut to forget

There is the option of washing at no charge, but I'm nit inclined to get a haircut with alternating cold and hot water.
