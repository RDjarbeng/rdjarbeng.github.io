## The journey to Kampala

The rest of the journey was in the dark so we didn't see much. Intermittently there were these rumble strips that shook the bus and made the seat vibrate. It made it very difficult for me to sleep.

A taste of Pilau (a bit similar to jollof rice)

A hearty breakfast at the Silver Springs hotel. Compliments to the chef.

Toastaster's conference and award winners

At the break of the conference there was actually a vendor selling pictures of people taken randomly throughout the event. Talk about the entrepreneurship spirit. Here's one photo that captured me whilst I was unaware.

This was taken shortly after checkout from the hotel. That sculpture of the president was ... interesting.

I couldn't believe it was over and we were headed back to Kigali. The sights of Kampala, the food, the people, the food. I said food twice didn't I.

The trip back to Kigali was in the day. We left Kampala some time before 8am.

On the bright side we get to see attractions on the road we didn't see earlier when we passed at night. I'll add some of the photos I took on the way back to Kigali. Most of the places we passed outside of the towns were mostly green fields as far as the eyes could see with occasional herds of cows.

I like this photo. Taken somewhere in Lwengo, after passing Bulimbale

Cows, long horn cows

A rest stop after some hours in the bus. Still in Uganda.
