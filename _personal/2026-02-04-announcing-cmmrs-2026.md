The small, select group of attendees will be exposed to state-of-the-art research in computer science, have the opportunity to interact one-on-one with internationally leading scientists from three of the foremost academic institutions in research and higher learning in the US and in Europe, and network with like-minded students. They will get a sense of what it is like to pursue an academic or an industrial research career in computer science and have a head start when applying for graduate school.

For full consideration, applications should be received by February 14, 2026 AOE. Travel and accommodation will be covered for accepted students. Further information about the school and how to apply can be found at [https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/)
