Welcome to my personal gallery of memes and pictures that have made me laugh, think, or just nod in solemn agreement. In the vast, chaotic landscape of the internet, these are a few of the gems I found... interesting

This particular strip, featuring a meeting to discuss why nothing works, is a painfully accurate summary of corporate inefficiency.

For this meme, the text is mine. Itâ€™s for the two types of people in this world: those who diligently update their PCs the moment a notification appears, and those who have a 3,457-hour uptime and live by the motto "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

A Moment of Absence: Buffett and Munger
This one is less of a meme and more of a poignant moment. It shows Warren Buffett at a meeting after his longtime partner, Charlie Munger, had passed away. For decades, they sat side-by-side, and Buffett would turn to Charlie for his opinion. Here, he instinctively does so again. A powerful image about friendship, habit, and loss. Charlie was vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett, from 1978 until his death in 2023.
