Got another update from my friend Robert on his Europe trip! Today, he's in **Prague, Czech Republic**, and sent me some really cool stuff.

## This Crazy Spinning Kafka Statue

First up, check out this incredible statue called the **Head of Franz Kafka**. It's huge; 11 meters tall, and made of 42 layers of steel that are constantly moving. The pieces spin around, and Kafka's face comes together and then breaks apart again. The different part of the face moves in horizontal slices, the eyes, nose and mouth giving it an outworldly almost alien vibe. It looks wild especially at night.

You can find it right outside the Quadrio shopping centre. Here's a link if you want to see the official page:

It does a full show for about 15 minutes at the top of every hour where individual parts spin. Robert was there at night and took this video:

Seriously, how cool is that? It's awesome getting to see bits of Europe through his trip, and I love sharing the cool finds with you all. This is definitely on my list of things to see in person one day.

### Diving Deeper into Franz Kafka's World

The statue really brings to life the mind of the author it represents. Franz Kafka was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His works often explore themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and the absurdity of bureaucracy.

Some of his most famous works include:

- **The Metamorphosis:** This novella tells the bizarre story of salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a giant insect. It's a powerful exploration of isolation and the dehumanizing aspects of modern life.
- **The Trial:** An unfinished novel about Josef K., a man arrested and prosecuted by an inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime never revealed to him or the reader. It delves into themes of guilt, justice, and oppressive systems.
- **The Castle:** Another unfinished novel, where a land surveyor named K. arrives in a village dominated by a mysterious castle and struggles endlessly to gain access to its authorities. It's a parable about bureaucracy, detachment, and the elusive search for belonging.

And yes, Kafka is absolutely related to the word **"Kafkaesque"**! This adjective is used to describe concepts, situations, or experiences that are reminiscent of his writings – typically complex, bizarre, illogical, or nightmarishly bureaucratic systems that are hard to escape.

## Prague's Ancient Astronomical Wonder: The Orloj

Robert also shared a picture of another incredible Prague landmark – the **Astronomical Clock**, known locally as the Orloj, located on the Old Town Hall. This isn't just any clock; it's a masterpiece of medieval engineering and art!

Installed in 1410, it's the third oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still operating. It's designed to show more than just the time of day! The clock face itself is a medieval astronomical dial representing the position of the Sun and Moon, along with various astronomical details.

And yes, it's absolutely related to zodiac signs! The outer ring of the clock displays the **Zodiac signs**, indicating the position of the Sun in relation to them. It also shows Bohemian time, Old German time, and the phases of the moon. Every hour, on the hour, between 9 AM and 11 PM, a procession of the Twelve Apostles appears through two windows above the clock face, making it a truly enchanting spectacle. It's like watching history, astronomy, and art all come alive at once!

## You Mean Apples Grow on Trees for Free?!

But it wasn't just giant metal heads and ancient clocks today. Later on, Robert saw something that really surprised him: apple trees in a public park, with real, edible apples just hanging there for free.

He was amazed because, back home in Ghana, we're so used to buying expensive apples from sellers in traffic. And here they are just... growing in a park for anyone. It's funny how the simplest things can be the most surprising when you're somewhere new.

That's it from Prague for now! Can't wait to see where he ends up next.
