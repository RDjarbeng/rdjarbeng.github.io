Got another update from my friend Robert on his Europe trip\! Today, he's in **Prague, Czech Republic**, and sent me some really cool stuff.

## This Crazy Spinning Kafka Statue

First up, check out this incredible statue called the **Head of Franz Kafka**. It's huge; 11 meters tall,and made of 42 layers of steel that are constantly moving. The pieces spin around, and Kafka's face comes together and then breaks apart again. The different part of the face moves in horizontal slices, the eyes, nose and mouth giving it an outworldly almost alien vibe. It looks wild especially at night.

You can find it right outside the Quadrio shopping centre. Here's a link if you want to see the official page:

It does a full show for about 15 minutes at the top of every hour where individual parts spin. Robert was there at night and took this video.

Seriously, how cool is that? It's awesome getting to see bits of Europe through his trip, and I love sharing the cool finds with you all. This is definitely on my list of things to see in person one day.

## You Mean Apples Grow on Trees for Free?\!

But it wasn't just giant metal heads today. Later on, Robert saw something that really surprised him: apple trees in a park, with real, edible apples just hanging there for free.

He was amazed because, back home in Ghana, we're so used to buying expensive apples from sellers in traffic. And here they are just... growing in a park for anyone. It's funny how the simplest things can be the most surprising when you're somewhere new.

That's it from Prague for now\! Can't wait to see where he ends up next.
