I'm continuing to live vicariously through my friend Robert Ayetey's European tour, and today's update comes from the beautiful city of **Prague, Czech Republic**. He shared a couple of experiences that were too good not to share.

#### The Mechanical Mind of Franz Kafka

The highlight of his day was a visit to a truly unique and mesmerizing piece of public art: **The Head of Franz Kafka**. This massive, 11-meter-tall kinetic statue, created by artist David Černý, is made of 42 rotating stainless steel layers.

It's located outside the Quadrio shopping centre, and you can find more details on its official page here:

The sculpture's layers constantly shift, deconstructing and reconstructing Kafka's face in a hypnotic display. Robert mentioned that the full, choreographed rotation happens for about 15 minutes at the top of every hour. He was there at night and captured a video of the incredible sight.

Watching the video, you can almost feel the complex and tormented genius the statue represents. It's one thing to see pictures, but another to see it in motion. I'm experiencing different parts of Europe as Robert travels, and I'm so glad I get to share the most interesting parts with all of you. One day, I hope to see it in person!

#### A Simple, Surprising Discovery

But the wonders of Prague weren't just in its grand sculptures. Earlier in the afternoon, Robert encountered something much simpler but equally astonishing to him: apple trees in a public park with perfectly edible apples, free for the taking!

Coming from Ghana, where we're used to seeing apples sold at high prices in traffic, the sight of them just growing on a tree for anyone to enjoy was, in his words, "amazing." It's these small cultural differences that often make travel so fascinating.

That's all the updates for today. Stay tuned for the next stop on Robert's journey!
