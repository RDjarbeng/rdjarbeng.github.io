Picture this it's Your first visit to Pittsburgh and you were picked up from the Pittsburgh International Airport after your long journey. On the drive from the airport you mostly pass through a countryside just seeing the hills and a few houses. Nothing fancy just a standard ride from for about 45 minutes and you are yet to see the city. It's night time and dark, you only see the silhouette of the hills on the horizon as the road weaves through what appears to be barren hills on a highway leading into the mountains. You don't really seem to be heading anywhere interesting and the road ahead looks just as gloomy as the road behind. The most interesting thing so far was the airport you left with their statues of dinosaurs and robots.

You enter a tunnel and the only sound is noise from the car engines, nothing fancy, nothing interesting.

From the wilderness, then the tunnel everything seems boring, then tadaa! ðŸ¤©Feast your eyes on the city of Pittsburgh. You exit the tunnel and you are greeted by a most spectacular view of the city of Pittsburgh with a skyline full of lights and the river reflecting that light as you exit the tunnel. All of a sudden the ones boring view is now changed with spectacular awesome skyline as you pass along the bridge that connects the tunnel to the city.  Here are some pictures I got of the Pittsburgh skyline which is the best I could do at describing this without words.

Honestly this experience was expected. I had been told to anticipate it by students who had already been there, but seeing it for myself was breathtaking it's a difficult thing one doesn't just get used to. This was my experience in January 2024 when I first arrived in Pittsburgh for an exchange semester at Carnegie Mellon University.

Here's a video I found on Youtube showing the exit from the tunnel.

The view shown in the video doesn't do justice to the experience. As I said before, I was told about it, before hand and I was expecting it yet was still left in awe.
