What's the difference between TED and TEDx talks on youtube?

TED has their own website. Who can give a TED talk?

What's with the red circle?

My favorites:

These are ted talks that had me at: (Insert Peter Griffin clapping sequence)
Inside the mind of a master procrastinator

An astronaut and fear, what are you afraid of

Inside the brain neurosurgeon

Apparently there are banned/removed TED talks.

Ideas worth sharing
