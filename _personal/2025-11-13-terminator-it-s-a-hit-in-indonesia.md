Ghanaian Afrobeats star **King Promise** unleashed _"Terminator"_ in May 2023, but the remix featuring Nigeria's **Young Jonn**—dropped in July—turned it into a continental and international smash. This post dives into the remix (the one with **71M+ YouTube views** as of November 2025), while giving props to the original.

## The Video: Sci-Fi Intro Meets Afrobeats Swagger

Don't let the title fool you—this isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1984 classic. The remix opens with an 8-second **low-budget CGI homage**: King Promise, bald head gleaming and rocking dark shades, levitates in a futuristic lab as electric crackles zap across the screen.

Cut to reality: a blurred bedroom scene with on-screen song credits...

...followed by sweeping **drone shots over Ghanaian settlements**, grounding the track in vibrant African energy.

## Why the Young Jonn Remix Hits Harder

- **Young Jonn's verse** adds Nigerian flair and catchy ad-libs.
- **Richer bass** and punchier beats elevate the production.
- **71M YouTube views** (vs. original's strong but lower count)—proof of its viral edge.

No gatekeeping here: stream both below and decide for yourself.

_How does a Ghana-Nigeria collab blow up in Indonesia (pop. 270M+)?_ Afrobeats' borderless appeal. The screenshot above shows a fan expressing how this Terminator song is so big in Indonesia. Fun fact about Indonesia is that this country has the 4th largest population in the world. Now I'm not saying that's why this video in particular has so many viewers, but it's just an observation.

Another gem:

> "Its a good song we lov it in Uganda" (typo preserved)

King Promise is putting **Ghana on the world map**.

### Remix feat. Sean Paul, Tiwa Savage - Terminator (934K views)

I have a confession to make. Before making this post I didn't know that there was a third version; a remix with Tiwa Savage and Sean Paul. This was uploaded to YouTube on December, 3rd 2023. In my defense it wasn't as popular as the Young Jonn remix but I'm still going to shamelessly include it here.
