Ghanaian Afrobeats star **King Promise** unleashed *"Terminator"* in May 2023, but the remix featuring Nigeria's **Young Jonn**—dropped in July—turned it into a continental and international smash. This post dives into the remix (the one with **71M+ YouTube views** as of November 2025), while giving props to the original.

## The Video: Sci-Fi Intro Meets Afrobeats Swagger

Don't let the title fool you—this isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1984 classic. The remix opens with an 8-second **low-budget CGI homage**: King Promise, bald head gleaming and rocking dark shades, levitates in a futuristic lab as electric crackles zap across the screen.

...followed by sweeping **drone shots over Ghanaian settlements**, grounding the track in vibrant African energy.

## Why the Young Jonn Remix Hits Harder

- **Young Jonn's verse** adds Nigerian flair and catchy ad-libs.
- **Richer bass** and punchier beats elevate the production.
- **71M YouTube views** (vs. original's strong but lower count)—proof of its viral edge.

No gatekeeping here: stream both below and decide for yourself.
