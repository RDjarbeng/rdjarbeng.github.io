King Promise, a Ghanaian musician launched a banger in July, 2023

# King Promise - Terminator feat. Young Jonn

If you thought from the title that this was from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that came out in 1984 then you are wrong. There is a reference to the terminator movie at the start with some kinda low-budget CGI with sounds of electricity cackling. The scene shows King Promise in dark shades and his regular bald head levitating in some kind of sci-fi futuristic looking lab. This scene runs for about 8 seconds before we get back to the song. Back to reality. Probably not the terminator you were looking for if you were searching for the movie.

He faces the camera, wearing futuristic black sunglasses that have a white and blue lightning effect arcing across the lenses. He wears a dark jacket and a silver star pendant, illuminated by dramatic blue lighting.](/assets/images/20251113-122318.png "Screenshot of King Promise wearing futuristic lightning sunglasses in 'Terminator'")

Now the actual song starts showing a blurred view of what appears to be a bedroom for King Promise.

This is followed by a drone shot of some buildings in what appears to be a settlement in Africa most likely Ghana.

In the YouTube comments for the video someone commented:

> This song is very viral in Indonesia🇮🇩

As to how a song by a Ghanaian artiste collaborating with a Nigerian artiste becomes a hit in Indonesia your guess is as good as mine.
