Did Pavel Durov unknowingly predict his own arrest with this light-hearted post?

*Original post from @durov – Pavel Durov’s official Telegram channel, posted months before his arrest*

In this now widely-circulated update, Durov wrote (translated from Russian):  
> “The Middle East is getting pretty warm these days… France remains the best holiday destination in the world.”

A seemingly innocent joke about the summer heat — until you realize what happened next.

#### Timeline of Events
- **August 25, 2024, ~20:00 local time**  
  Pavel Durov’s private jet (Embraer Legacy 600, tail number TC-SAB) lands at **Le Bourget Airport**, Paris.  
  As soon as he clears passport control using his **French passport**, he is immediately arrested by French police.

- **Charges (as reported by French authorities)**  
  - Complicity in running an online platform enabling illicit transactions  
  - Refusal to cooperate with law enforcement (decrypting messages)  
  - Complicity in distribution of child sexual abuse material  
  - Involvement in drug trafficking and organized crime facilitated via Telegram  
  (Full list of 12 charges confirmed by the Paris prosecutor)

- **Citizenships**  
  Russia (born), United Arab Emirates (primary residence in Dubai), **France** (obtained in 2021), Saint Kitts and Nevis

- **Why this matters**  
  Durov had publicly avoided Europe for years, claiming he feared arrest in EU countries. This appears to have been one of the very few times he traveled to France since receiving French citizenship — and authorities were ready.
