On April 20, 2024, Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya made history by shattering the Guinness World Record for the longest chess marathon, playing continuously for over 60 hours in New York’s iconic Times Square. This extraordinary feat surpassed the previous record of 56 hours, 9 minutes, and 37 seconds, set by Norwegian players Hallvard Haug Flatebø and Sjur Ferkingstad in 2018.

### A Mission to Educate Nigerian Children

Tunde’s marathon wasn’t just about breaking a record; it was a powerful statement with a purpose. His goal was to raise $1 million to support chess education for children in Nigeria, particularly those in underserved communities. As the founder of Chess in Slums Africa, Onakoya has dedicated his life to using chess as a tool to empower underprivileged children, drawing inspiration from his own beginnings learning the game in a slum in Ikorodu, Lagos. This record-breaking effort underscores his belief in the transformative power of education and opportunity.

## "It Is Possible to Do Great Things from a Small Place"

Reflecting on his journey, he shared a poignant message: _“It is possible to do great things from a small place.”_ This philosophy encapsulates his mission to uplift children from humble beginnings, showing that even the smallest communities can produce monumental impact. His marathon, streamed live and covered by major media outlets like CNN, the New York Times, and the BBC, has inspired millions worldwide and highlighted the potential of chess as a vehicle for change.
