Split fiction co-op game. Available on steam.

How it's played

A split screen game where the screen is split vertically and each player has their own character and camera control. Different approach from previous co-op games such as Mortal Kombat-Shaolin Monks where the players all share a single screen that zooms to fit them. Or other split screen games, racing games such as need for speed that split the screen horizontally.

## References to other games

Interesting story line that blends many genres of gaming. The sliding down the slopes reminds me of Temple run and there is a very clear reference to Assassin's creed particularly the dive from a height into a body of water which realistically would kill a person.

## Varied perspective as one character

It's an interesting perspective.

For those who have played it as one character they may find the experience to be very different when they play as a certain character. Typical example at the beginning of the game I played as the gunner and the second player pilots the gunship. This is for a section where you steal a gunship and have to escape from the other ships trying to shoot you down. As the gunner I was in charge of shooting down the other ships trying to return the favor and shoot us down. I got annoyed at the pilot (2nd player) at the end and asked him why he was moving in a straight line did he want us to be shot down. His response, he wasn't moving in a straight line, but making evasive maneuvers throughout. Oops I was so focused on my role as the gunner that I couldn't see things from his perspective.

### Split fiction splitting friendships

I think the game comes with the warning that it has split friendships, I suppose it makes sense now if each player has such a different perspective of what the other is doing.

Maybe if you finish playing you might want to switch, start the game over and play from the other player's perspective. Maybe then it wouldn't seem like the other player is being a doofus!
