Bill Withers- Lean on Me

Headphones recommended; There is a baseline on this one that I didn't really hear clearly until I used headphones

Nightshift- the commodores

Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down

- The song delivers on it's promise

The instrumentals: bass line, drums, guitar exquisite, sublime

Never too much- A thousand Kisses Luther Van Dross

Will you be there - Michael Jackson

Was used in the sound track for the movie Free Willy, I wonder what the story behind that is and the story behind the lyrics.

The mmhmm of this song is a part that everyone can sing. Some parts of the song are hard to sing for a beginner/amateur vocalist  so I'm just gonna mmhmm

A very relaxing song from the king of Pop
