As Valentine's Day approaches, lovers across East Africa will have to rethink their gift ideas as Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda have all taken a firm stance against the popular trend of cash bouquets. Central banks in these nations have issued warnings or outright bans on the practice, citing the degradation of currency notes.

In **Kenya**, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has explicitly prohibited the use of Kenyan shilling banknotes in cash bouquets and similar decorative gifts, effective February 2, 2026. The CBK emphasized that folding, rolling, and gluing banknotes compromises their physical integrity, making them unfit for circulation. This willful mutilation is considered a criminal offense under Section 367 of the Penal Code.

**Rwanda** has similarly declared war on cash bouquets. The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has warned that using banknotes for decorative purposes is a criminal offense punishable by fines and potential imprisonment. The NBR highlighted that such practices damage the economy by rendering notes unusable for sorting machines and ATMs. Florists and event planners have been instructed to cease these services immediately.

**Uganda** has joined the regional crackdown, with the Bank of Uganda (BoU) cautioning the public against defacing currency. The BoU warned that using glue, tape, or pins on banknotes for gifts like money cakes or bouquets compromises the currency's integrity. While gifting cash is acceptable, the willful destruction of banknotes is punishable under the Bank of Uganda Act.

**Nigeria** has also taken a strong stance against this trend. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has listed money bouquets as a form of naira abuse, emphasizing that such practices deface the legal tender. Offenders risk imprisonment or fines for treating the national currency with disrespect. [Source: Daily Post Nigeria](https://dailypost.ng/2023/02/10/cbn-lists-money-bouquet-as-naira-abuse/)

The consensus among these central banks is clear: money is for circulation, not decoration. The practice of creating cash bouquets not only disrespects the currency but also imposes significant costs on taxpayers due to the need for early replacement of damaged notes.

For this Valentine's season, traditional flowers or digital money transfers might be the safer—and legal—choice.
