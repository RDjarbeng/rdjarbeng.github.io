Usually I delete spam/phishing emails, but this one was so blatantly fake and hilarious that I had to make a post about it. Here is the full unedited email I received, allegedly from Elon Musk himself!

My favorite part is this completely disjointed paragraph: *"If you are yet to own or be an active stake holder in Tesla Stakehold Club, this is a great opportunity to join us... knowing that you are joining a mission that has evolved in 2026 from accelerating sustainable energy to a broader goal."* What? It starts off talking about a 'stakehold club' (whatever that means) and ends up vaguely rambling about a broader goal.

And the best part? They really expect someone to believe that the second richest man in the world—after me, of course 😅—is out here sending personal emails to ensure random people "earn profits as little as $10k-$20k weekly." 😆
