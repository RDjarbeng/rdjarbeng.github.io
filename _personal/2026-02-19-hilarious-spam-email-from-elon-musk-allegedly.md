Usually I delete spam/phishing emails but this one is so funny I decided to make a post about it. ![](/assets/images/1000363354.png)

Part of the email says:

"If you are yet to own or be an active stake holder in Tesla Stakehold Club, this is a great opportunity to join us and own shares in Tesla stakehold knowing that you are joining a mission that has evolved in 2026 from accelerating sustainable energy to a broader goal."

What? The paragraph starts off in one direction about a 'stakeholder club' and ends up in another  direction talking about a broader goal? 

Reply I'm interested if you are new to Tesla stakeholds and will like to own a small part of Tesla stakehold giving you a chance to earn profits as little as $10k-$20k weekly just by investing into Tesla stock shares as we continue to grow and build a World of Amazing Abundance"

They really expect someone to believe the Second richest man in the world, after me of course 😅, sends emails asking people to buy Tesla shares. 😆
