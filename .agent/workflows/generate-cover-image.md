# Cover Image Generation Guidelines
When generating cover images for this website, please adhere to the following specifications to ensure consistency and brand identity.

## Specifications

1.  **Text Overlay**:
    *   The image MUST include the **title** of the post or a short, **interesting hook** to grab the reader's attention.
    *   Typography should be modern, bold, and legible.

2.  **Watermark**:
    *   The text `rdjarbeng.com` MUST be included as a watermark on the image.
    *   Placement: subtle but visible, typically at the bottom center or bottom right.

3.  **Color Palette**:
    *   **Primary Colors** (Red, Blue, Yellow) are preferred.
    *   Use bold, vibrant, and high-contrast color schemes.

4.  **Content & Style**:
    *   **Capture the Essence**: The image should be specific to the post's topic. Avoid vague, generic, or abstract abstract art that doesn't convey meaning.
    *   **Not Vague**: If the post is about a specific technology, visualize that technology. If it's about a leaderboard, show a leaderboard.
    *   **Aesthetic**: Modern, sleek, "tech-forward" and professional.
    *   **Performance First**: While quality is important, prioritize web-optimized images. Images do NOT need to be 4k. High-definition (1080p equivalent) is sufficient to ensure fast loading times on the homepage.

## Example Prompt Structure
When asking for an image generation, the prompt should look something like this:
> "A modern [subject] illustration using primary colors. Text overlay says '[Title]'. Watermark 'rdjarbeng.com' at the bottom. **High quality, web-optimized, high-definition (HD)**."
