# Cover Image Generation Guidelines
When generating cover images for this website, please adhere to the following specifications to ensure consistency and brand identity.

## Specifications

1.  **Text Overlay**:
    *   The image MUST include a short, **interesting hook** to grab the reader's attention or the **title** of the post.
    *   Typography should be modern, bold, and legible.

2.  **Watermark**:
    *   The text `rdjarbeng.com` MUST be included as a watermark on the image.
    *   Placement: subtle but visible, typically at the bottom center or bottom right.

3.  **Color Palette**:
    *   **Primary Colors** (Red, Blue, Yellow) are preferred for Text, Pick one color for the text without mix. Other colors can be used outside of the text.
    *   Use bold, vibrant, and high-contrast color schemes.

4.  **Content & Style**:
    *   **Style**: Use **Flat Vector Art**, **Editorial Illustration**, or **Minimalist Geometric** styles.
    *   **Texture**: Use **Matte** finishes. Avoid shiny, glossy, or metallic textures.
    *   **Capture the Essence**: The image should be specific to the post's topic.
    *   **Not Vague**: If the post is about a specific technology, visualize that technology. If it's about a leaderboard, show a leaderboard.
    *   **Aesthetic**: Professional, clean, and distinct.
    *   **Anti-Patterns (STRICT)**:
        *   **NO** glowing blue neon networks.
        *   **NO** "cyberpunk" or generic "matrix" backgrounds.
        *   **NO** "abstract tech nodes" connecting dots.
        *   **NO** typical "AI generated" look (excessive lens flares, hyper-realism).

5.  **Dimensions**: 
    *   The image MUST have an aspect ratio of **16:9**. Recommended dimensions are **1280x720** or **1920x1080**. This is critical as the website cards are fixed to this ratio.
    *   **Performance First**: Prioritize web-optimized images. High-definition (1080p equivalent) is sufficient.

## Example Prompt Structure
When asking for an image generation, the prompt should look something like this:
> "A **flat vector illustration** of [subject] using a **matte** finish. **Solid** primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow). Clean lines, **white or light background**. Text overlay says '[Title]'. Watermark 'rdjarbeng.com' at the bottom. **No neon, no glow, editorial style**. **16:9 Aspect Ratio**."
