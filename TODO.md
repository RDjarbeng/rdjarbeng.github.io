# Developer To-Do List & Notes

This file tracks issues, bugs, and future improvements for the [rdjarbeng.com](https://rdjarbeng.com) codebase.

## High Priority
- [ ] **Move gallery captions out of Front Matter**: Currently, captions for gallery items (images/videos) are stored in the YAML Front Matter. This should be moved to the markdown body to leverage full markdown rendering and avoid YAML parsing issues with multiline strings.
- [ ] **Fix Gallery Titles**: Investigate why all gallery pages show the same title.

## Enhancements & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Contact Overlay**: Implement background for the contact overlay at the bottom.
- [ ] **Contact Form**: Add dropdown to website contact form to append reason for user's query.
- [ ] **Telegram Bot**: Test bot for memes. Deploy (PythonAnywhere or Oracle Cloud Free Tier).
- [ ] **Cover Images**: Investigate how to position cover images so they are not cut off (maybe add adjust on upload feature).

## Content Ideas & Drafts
- [ ] **Ananse**: Finish Ananse website post.
- [ ] **Review**: Food Ghana vs Nigeria Jollof.
- [ ] **Tech**: Write Google DeepMind post about [Agent 57](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark/).
- [ ] **TikTok**: Post "What you are sold online vs what you see" (guns in my head).
- [ ] **Design**: Create banners with my model templates.

## Research & Questions
- [ ] Are there any studies on how the air quality changes after a plane flies past?
- [ ] What is Shopify?
