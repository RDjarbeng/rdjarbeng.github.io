# Developer To-Do List & Notes

This file tracks issues, bugs, and future improvements for the [rdjarbeng.com](https://rdjarbeng.com) codebase.

## High Priority
- [ ] **Move gallery captions out of Front Matter**: Currently, captions for gallery items (images/videos) are stored in the YAML Front Matter. This should be moved to the markdown body to leverage full markdown rendering and avoid YAML parsing issues with multiline strings.

## Low Priority
- Test telegram bot for memes, deploy python anywhere, oracle cloud free tier
Gallery pages all show the same title
Implement background for the contact overlay at the bottom
