# Developer To-Do List & Notes

This file tracks issues, bugs, and future improvements for the [rdjarbeng.com](https://rdjarbeng.com) codebase.

## High Priority

- Improve home page so that it shows the rich content of the site, currently shows a number of posts and contact info, not very impressive

- [ ] **Fix Gallery Titles**: Investigate why all gallery pages show the same title.

## Enhancements & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Contact Overlay**: Implement background for the contact overlay at the bottom.
- [ ] **Contact Form**: Add dropdown to website contact form to append reason for user's query. Automated reply should come from website email.
- [ ] **Card layouts**: Cards are not shown in the table of contents.
- [ ] **Cover Images**: Investigate how to position cover images so they are not cut off (maybe add adjust on upload feature).
Card images have a top padding that leaves a gray space

## Content Ideas & Drafts
- [ ] **Ananse**: Finish Ananse website post.
- [ ] **Review**: Food Ghana vs Nigeria Jollof.
- [ ] **Tech**: Write Google DeepMind post about [Agent 57](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark/).
- [ ] **TikTok**: Post "What you are sold online vs what you see" (guns in my head).
- [ ] **Design**: Create banners with my model templates.

## Research & Questions
- [ ] Are there any studies on how the air quality changes after a plane flies past?
- [ ] What is Shopify?

Preparations for CMMRS visa appointment booking, and checklists.

This post is for the experience of going to Germany, we are going to skip the details of CMMRS focusing on the travel experience and the differences for someone coming first to Germany. Starting from the preparation to depart Kigali, move disappointed me, almost missed the flight, left one person at the airport,  (some lava fields which I am not sure what those are) transit in Ethiopia, Landing in Frankfurt Intl Airport, restaurants, train station connected to the airport,  a transportation nightmare after entering a new country for the first time 7 hours after landing we were on the move. AutoBahn cars were just overtaking the bus. We got to KaiserSlautern and the train platform had changed, we couldn’t decipher the signs, but luckily I had a friend who lives in Germany who used the app to confirm the train platform,  we had to move quickly. To move between platforms we used elevators.
 Found the platform and train and the doors slammed shut on us. Was ready to give up then, till one lady pushed the button and the doors opened, we are so back. Arrived in Saarbrucken, nice train station, nice flowers. Navigating the trams and buses was another issue and we missed our stop so had to get off and walk the rest of the way. That’s how we made it to the Europa youth hostel. Check-in was at 2pm so we had to wait. It’s good to be in Germany. Now to wait for the start of the program. 
Experience in Frankfurt, no uber in Saarbrucken, the trains (day ticket, airport ticket), navigation, Doner Kebab and Indian restaurant; that’s how you get people to come back, people smoking, turns out I’m lactose intolerant, Galeria luxury mall, MyZeil,  (not gonna mention IBIS budget)

The gallery section just looks uninteresting on mobile view, I think it's the layout, I'm not sure how to fix it, I'll have to look into it. Memes need to be scrollable

Unet paper for image segmentation, one of the top models for images segmentation has github repo where they give updates. Last update was in 2024. Seems countless projects are running off this on the web and Iphone using Unet or some variant such as rembg in the app. Examples are background removers, portrait makers…, Find the paper here-https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09007 I recently discover


Tried out wan2-1 fast image to video model on Hugging face. Has a short duration (default 2 seconds able to get it to 3.9 seconds after changing advanced settings. Seems to require medium prompts at least. So far focuses on one object and doesn’t seem to be able to animate multiple objects at once. Running this I had to wait for a GPU on hugging face many times, because it was running on GPU-Zero. On the bright side it was able to work with this sketch of Ananse. Run out of GPU zero before I could test more. (screenshot in website folder)-https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/wan2-1-fast
Seems after the papers are submitted to CVPR the projects are abandoned and not maintained. Tried this  (https://huggingface.co/collections/SkalskiP/cvpr-2025-684984ecbb1dc930f52876b8)CVPR 2025, updated Jun 11, 2025 about a month ago, when I wrote this it was 21st July, 2025

Possible improvements
- Here is the strategic roadmap:

1. Doubling Daily Active Users (2x DAU)
The focus here is on Distribution and Search Intent.

Programmatic SEO for AI Trends: Since you work with YOLO World and Gemini, I would create a series of "Solution Recipes"—short, highly searchable posts solving specific technical hurdles (e.g., "How to deploy YOLO World on a Raspberry Pi"). These capture long-tail search traffic from developers.
The "Project-to-Post" Pipeline: Every time you update a project like MAHORAGA or the Lyric Video Generator, I would automate the generation of a "Build Log." Sharing these technical journeys on LinkedIn and Twitter (where you're already active) drives high-intent referral traffic.
Newsletter Integration: Implement a "Digital Garden" style newsletter. Instead of a standard blog, treat it as a recurring update on your AI research. This converts one-time visitors into the "Daily Active" cohort.
GitHub Cross-Pollination: Ensure every README in your repositories (like rdjarbeng.github.io) has a "Learn how this was built" link leading back to a specific deep-dive on the site.
2. Increasing Time Spent by 35%
The focus here is on Interactivity and Content Loops.

Live Interactive Demos: Instead of just screenshots, I would suggest embedding "Lite" versions of your projects directly in the posts. If a user can play with a YOLO World detector or a TTS preview in-browser, their session duration will skyrocket.
Series-Based Architecture: Reorganize content into "Tracks" (e.g., The Autonomous Trading Track). At the end of every post, use a "Next in Series" prompt rather than just "Related Posts." This creates a "binge-reading" effect.
Technical Deep-Dives (The 2,000+ Word Rule): Transition from 500-word overviews to 2,000-word authoritative guides. Detailed tutorials with annotated code blocks and architectural diagrams (using the landscape screenshots you prefer) naturally keep users on the page longer.
Readability UX: Improve the "In-App" feel by adding:
Estimated Reading Time: Sets expectations.
Table of Contents (Sticky): Allows users to jump to sections of interest without leaving.
Code "Copy" and "Play" buttons: Increases interaction events within the page.
